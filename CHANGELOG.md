## [Unreleased] — B40 Redesign · Sprint 10: apply form ② — My Plans + Support + "received" (2026-05-24)

The second half of the apply form. Frontend only (every field was already accepted by `ApplicationCreateSerializer`
since S7); on `feature/b40-redesign`, not deployed.

### Added
- **My Plans**: "intend to continue tertiary study" gate checkbox; **pathways considering** multi-select chips;
  **UPU / destination** radio (with an inline amber note when "private (IPTS)" is picked — IPTS-only is out of
  scope and the S8 engine declines it); **field of study** dropdown (from the field taxonomy); **top-3 course
  choices** picked from the student's **saved courses** (ranked by tap order, max 3, friendly empty-state);
  **other scholarships** multi-select chips + free text → funding-overlap signal.
- **My Support**: help-with-university + help-with-scholarship radios (optional, Yes/No/Not sure), "anything else"
  free text, required consent.
- `scholarship.ts`: plans/support form state + payload mapping (`top_choices` ranked by order) + constants
  (`UPU_OPTIONS`, `HELP_OPTIONS`, `OTHER_SCHOLARSHIP_OPTIONS`, `TopChoice`); apply page fetches saved courses
  (exam-type aware) + field taxonomy on mount. EN/MS/TA i18n.

### Changed
- The apply form's single `intended_pathway` select is replaced by the `pathways_considered` multi-select; the
  `notes` free-text is replaced by `anything_else`. `intends_tertiary_2026` kept (engine hard gate) as a checkbox.

### Notes
- The post-submit **"Application received"** screen already works (S8's silent-score keeps status `submitted`, so the
  application page shows the neutral "received — we'll be in touch" card; the follow-up only appears once shortlisted).
  No auto-advance.

### Tests
- Frontend jest **49** (top_choices builder + plans/support payload; replaces the dropped notes test). Backend unchanged (1095).

## [Unreleased] — B40 Redesign · Sprint 9b: My Results edit → onboarding round-trip (2026-05-24)

Wires the apply form's My Results "edit/add results" into the full onboarding flow and brings the student back
without losing in-progress edits. Frontend only; on `feature/b40-redesign`, not deployed.

### Changed
- **My Results "edit / add results"** now routes through the **full onboarding** (`/onboarding/exam-type` → grades
  → … → "a few more details") instead of `/profile` or `/quiz`, so the profile ends up complete for course
  recommendations too.
- The **final onboarding step** is context-aware: entered from the apply form, its button reads **"Save & return
  to application"** and routes back to `/scholarship/apply` (otherwise unchanged → dashboard).

### Added
- **Stash & restore** of in-progress About-Me/My-Family edits across the onboarding detour (sessionStorage): the
  form only commits on submit, so edits are stashed before leaving and restored on return (landing on the Results
  tab). Helpers `stashApplyForm` / `popApplyStash` / `hasApplyReturn` / `clearApplyReturn` (storage-injectable,
  SSR-safe); orphan return-marker cleared on a normal apply visit.
- i18n `onboarding.saveReturnToApplication`; Results CTA copy updated (edit/add → onboarding).

### Tests
- Frontend jest **44 → 49** (stash/restore round-trip, marker set/clear, SSR no-op). Backend unchanged (1095).

## [Unreleased] — B40 Redesign · Sprint 9: apply form ① — About Me + My Family (2026-05-24)

Apply-form rebuild, first half. Inline-editable **About Me** + **My Family**, commit-on-submit. Frontend +
small backend write-back; on `feature/b40-redesign`, not deployed. Mobile-first (desktop layout is S12).

### Changed
- **About Me** (was read-only "About You") is now **inline-editable**, pre-filled from the profile: full name,
  school, **NRIC** (editable until verified, read-only + "Verified" badge once locked), referring organisation,
  home state, phone. **Contact email is locked** (already verified). The old "Edit → /profile" bounce is gone.
- **Commit-on-submit** — edits live in form state; on a successful submit the About Me + My Family fields sync to
  the canonical profile (`sync_profile_fields`), and the **NRIC commits via the validated claim path** (never the
  application payload). A failed submit persists nothing.
- Section headings are first-person (**About Me**, **My Family**); tab labels stay short (About / Family / …).
- Validation now enforces the required About-Me fields (name, school, NRIC format, referring org, home state,
  phone) + household income, and **jumps the user to the offending tab**; the error banner moved out of the
  Support tab so it shows on whichever tab the error is on.

### Added
- **My Family**: parent/guardian **name + phone** (stored in `profile.guardians`) and **preferred call language**
  (en/ms/ta/mixed → `profile.preferred_call_language`); `i` tooltips on income, household, STR, JKM.
- Required `*` + `i` info-bubble tooltips across About Me + My Family (`InfoTip` + `FieldLabel` components).
- Referring-organisation **fixed dropdown** (9 legacy options) → stored as `referral_source`, resolved to the
  `referred_by_org` FK server-side when a matching active `PartnerOrganisation` exists.
- `scholarship.ts`: new form fields + `nricChanged`, `REFERRING_ORG_OPTIONS`, `CALL_LANGUAGE_OPTIONS`,
  `MALAYSIAN_STATES`; `ApplicationCreateSerializer` accepts the new write-only profile fields; profile GET returns
  `referral_source` + `guardians`. EN/MS/TA i18n (labels, tooltips, headings, validation).

### Tests
- Backend **1093 → 1095** (About-Me/Family write-back + referring-org FK resolution). Frontend jest **37 → 44**.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Redesign · Sprint 8: decision engine + silent-score + delayed reveal (2026-05-24)

The deterministic decision engine (final policy calls settled). Backend only; on `feature/b40-redesign`, not deployed.

### Changed
- **`shortlisting.py` rewritten** to the settled rule (no score/weights/hardship): hard gates (consent · intends
  public study · not IPTS-only) → academic floor (SPM ≥4 at A- AND ≥5 at B+ / STPM PNGK ≥2.9) → income (STR →
  pass, bucket A; else per-capita income < `per_capita_ceiling` RM1,584 → pass, bucket B). `evaluate()` returns
  `verdict` (shortlisted/rejected) + bucket + reason.
- **Submit no longer decides instantly** — it scores **silently** (`score_application`): stores verdict +
  `decision_due_at`, status stays `submitted`, only the acknowledgement email is sent.
- **Delayed reveal** via `send_pending_decision_emails` (now release-due-decisions): flips status + sends the
  email at `decision_due_at` — **+2h** shortlist (invitation), **+48h** decline (warm).
- **Decline email** rewritten warm (EN/MS/TA): "not successful this round, all the best, you're welcome at our
  higher-education seminars — we'll send invites."

### Added
- Cohort: `per_capita_ceiling` (1584), `min_spm_bplus_count` (5), `success_delay_hours` (2), `decline_delay_hours`
  (48); defaults `min_spm_a_count` 5→4, `min_stpm_pngk` 3.0→2.9.
- Application: `verdict`, `decision_due_at`, `decision_released_at`. Migration scholarship `0008`.

### Tests
- Backend **1093 pass** (golden masters intact). Rewrote engine tests (per-capita + academic-floor + IPTS + STR),
  scheduler tests (release-due / idempotent / dry-run), submit tests (silent score), cohort-defaults; added a
  per-verdict-delay scoring test.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Redesign · Sprint 7: backend foundation (soft-NRIC + intake fields) (2026-05-23)

Foundation for the decision-engine redesign + apply-form rebuild (6-sprint roadmap in
`docs/scholarship/b40-decision-redesign-plan.md`). Backend only; on `feature/b40-redesign`, not deployed.

### Added
- **`StudentProfile.nric_verified`** (Bool), **`coq_score`** (Float — co-curricular score now persisted,
  was transient), **`preferred_call_language`**. Profile GET returns all three.
- **`ScholarshipApplication`** new intake fields (all optional): `field_of_study`, `pathways_considered`,
  `top_choices`, `upu_status` (incl. an IPTS option), `other_scholarships` (+ free text), `help_university`,
  `help_scholarship`, `anything_else`, `mentoring_candidate`. Carried through the create serializer,
  `_APP_FIELDS`, the audit `intake_snapshot`, and the read serializer.
- Migrations: courses `0048`, scholarship `0007`.

### Changed
- **Soft-NRIC (supersedes "IC immutable"):** uniqueness now enforced **only when verified**
  (`unique_verified_nric` replaces `unique_nric_when_set`); NRIC is **read-only on PUT/sync** (claim path
  only); the claim endpoint **blocks a change once verified** (403 `nric_locked`). See `docs/decisions.md`.

### Tests
- Backend **1091 pass** (was 1086; +4 soft-NRIC, +1 intake round-trip), golden masters intact (SPM 5319,
  STPM 2026). Updated `test_profile_fields` (PUT no longer sets NRIC; uniqueness only when verified).

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1.5c public landing + follow-up route (2026-05-22)

Added the public marketing landing and gave the post-submission follow-up its own page.

### Added
- **`/scholarship/` landing** (public, no sign-in) — Stitch-designed, community self-help framing:
  hero + AI imagery, overview + value cards, a "Please note (pilot)" callout, a "Can you apply?"
  checklist (Indian-descent pilot, B40 < RM5,860, 5 A's / PNGK 3.0, public post-secondary), an
  8-step "How it works" timeline, a 10-item FAQ accordion, and a closing CTA. Renders with
  `AppHeader`/`AppFooter` like other content pages.
- **`/scholarship/application`** — the post-submission home: shortlisted students complete their
  follow-up (`ScholarshipNextSteps`) here; everyone else sees a neutral "received" status; visitors
  with no application are sent to apply. The apply page now redirects returning applicants here and
  routes here after submit (no more inline status branch).
- **AI imagery** (Gemini, via Stitch) saved as real assets: `public/scholarship/hero.jpg`,
  `community.jpg`. Hero is `priority`; the CTA image lazy-loads.
- **i18n**: `scholarship.landing.*` + `scholarship.application.*` in EN/MS/TA (1002 keys, parity
  verified). Gate button copy and all landing copy use the approved British-English wording.

### Tests / verification
- Jest **37 pass**; `next build` green (`/scholarship`, `/scholarship/application`, `/scholarship/apply`
  all compile). Live render check on `next dev` confirmed the landing renders (hero image, value cards,
  pilot callout, requirements, timeline, FAQ, CTA, footer). Not deployed.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1.5b apply-form frontend rebuild (2026-05-22)

Rebuilt the student apply flow to the profile-canonical API and the Stitch-approved design
(landing soft sign-in gate + tabbed 5-section form).

### Added / Changed
- **Soft sign-in gate** — anonymous visitors read the eligibility criteria freely and apply via a
  one-tap "Continue with Google" (the same button registers new students), with a "we'll use your
  profile so you never retype" reassurance. Replaces the old plain sign-in prompt.
- **Tabbed 5-section apply form** (Form A) — About You · Your Family · Your SPM/STPM Results ·
  Your Plans · Support, with a step progress bar + sticky bottom tab bar.
  - Sections 1 & 3 are **read-only, pre-filled from the profile** with "From your HalaTuju profile"
    badges and Edit links; results show A-count / A+ / STPM CGPA, or a "finish your quiz" prompt when
    the profile has no academic data yet.
  - Section 2 (Family) **writes financial fields back to the profile** (income, household size, STR/JKM
    toggles) with a "this also updates your HalaTuju profile" caption.
  - Academic data is **never posted** — the backend reads it from the profile.
- **`scholarship.ts`** — `ApplyFormState` slimmed to the financial + application fields;
  `profileToApplyDefaults` pre-fills financial from the profile; new `profileAcademicSummary` helper;
  `buildApplicationPayload`/`applyFormError` drop the academic fields.
- **API types** — `StudentProfile` gains the financial fields; student `ScholarshipApplication` uses
  `exam_type` (was `qualification`) and exposes `intake_snapshot`. (Admin types/serializer unchanged.)
- **i18n** — new `scholarship.apply.*` keys (gate, tabs, sections, read-only field labels, write-back
  note, results summary, empty states) in EN/MS/TA; 925 keys, parity verified.

### Tests
- `scholarship.test.ts` updated to the new shape (20 pass); full Jest **37 pass**; `next build` green
  (`/scholarship/apply` compiles). Not deployed.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1.5a source-of-truth refactor (2026-05-22)

Made the HalaTuju profile the single source of truth for applicant data, plus de-Gmailed email.

### Changed
- **Profile is canonical.** Moved academic (read from existing `grades`/`exam_type`/`stpm_cgpa`) and
  financial data to `courses.StudentProfile`: added `household_income`, `household_size`,
  `receives_str`, `receives_jkm`, `guardians` (migration `courses 0047`).
- **`ScholarshipApplication` slimmed** (migration `scholarship 0006`) — removed the duplicated
  `qualification`/`spm_a_count`/`stpm_pngk`/`household_income`/`household_size`/`receives_str`/
  `receives_jkm`; added `intake_snapshot` (immutable record of what was declared at submit time).
- **Shortlisting reads the profile live** — `shortlisting.evaluate()` scores academic + income from
  `application.profile`; intent + consent stay per-application. `count_spm_a_grades` now lives in
  `shortlisting.py`.
- **Apply flow writes back** — `services.sync_profile_fields` syncs the form's financial fields to the
  profile (non-None only, never blanks an existing value); `build_intake_snapshot` freezes the audit copy.
- **Serializers** — create accepts the financial write-back fields (write-only); read + admin serializers
  derive academic/financial from the profile and expose `intake_snapshot`.
- **Email de-Gmailed** — `production.py` email is now fully env-driven (Brevo SMTP relay default);
  no personal address in code. Deploy sets `EMAIL_HOST_USER`/`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` + verifies the sender domain.

### Tests
- Full backend suite **1086 pass**. Updated `test_shortlisting`/`test_api`/`test_models`/
  `test_admin_scholarship` for the profile-canonical shape; removed the obsolete
  "explicit a-count override" test; added write-back + snapshot coverage.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 6b (2026-05-22) — Phase 1 build complete

MyNadi admin console UI (frontend) — completes Sprint 6 and the Phase 1 build.

### Added
- **`/admin/scholarship`** — applications list with status + bucket filters.
- **`/admin/scholarship/[id]`** — full applicant detail (intake, funding, documents, referees,
  consent) + AI sponsor-profile panel: Generate → edit Markdown → Save → Publish, with status badge.
- Admin API client (`getScholarshipApplications`, `getScholarshipApplication`,
  `generateSponsorProfile`, `saveSponsorProfile`, `publishSponsorProfile`); "B40 Applications" nav link.
- i18n: `admin.scholarship.*` in EN/MS/TA (894 keys, parity verified).

### Tests
- Frontend suite **37 pass**; check-i18n PASS; `next build` — both admin pages compile.

### Phase 1 status
- **All 6 sprints complete.** Backend 1086 tests, frontend 37, golden masters intact, on
  `feature/b40-assistance` (not deployed). Remaining: the single Phase-1 deploy (carry-forwards) and
  Phase 0 legal/entity sign-off before public launch.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 6a (2026-05-22)

AI sponsor-profile drafting + MyNadi admin API (backend; the admin console UI is 6b).

### Added
- **`SponsorProfile` model** (OneToOne application; `draft_markdown`/`edited_markdown`, status
  draft→approved→published, `model_used`, timestamps; migration 0005, RLS).
- **`profile_engine.py`** — `generate_sponsor_profile()` drafts a sponsor-ready Markdown profile
  from intake + deeper-info + funding + grades + referee via the Gemini cascade (graceful error).
- **Admin API** (reuses `PartnerAdminMixin`, super-admin sees all): list applications (status/bucket
  filter), full detail (intake/funding/docs/referees/consents/profile), generate-profile, edit
  profile, publish — under `/api/v1/admin/scholarship/`.

### Tests
- 9 new (`test_admin_scholarship.py`, Gemini mocked). Full backend suite **1086 pass, 0 fail**;
  golden masters unchanged.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 5b (2026-05-22)

Document upload + referee + consent UI (frontend) — completes Sprint 5.

### Added
- **`ScholarshipDocuments`** — per-doc-type upload (sign → PUT straight to Supabase Storage →
  record), list with signed-URL view links + delete.
- **`ScholarshipReferee`** — add/list referees.
- **`ScholarshipConsent`** — DRAFT consent text + checkbox; guardian name/relationship fields when
  the applicant is a minor; "consent given" once recorded.
- Wired as steps 4–6 of the next-steps checklist.
- API client: sign-upload, direct PUT, record/list/delete docs, referee CRUD, consent get/record;
  `DOC_TYPES` + `formatFileSize` helpers.
- i18n: `scholarship.docs/referee/consent` + step 4–6 labels in EN/MS/TA (856 keys, parity verified).

### Tests
- 2 new helper tests (frontend suite **37 pass**); check-i18n PASS; `next build` success.

### Notes
- UI + network glue; the upload PUT-to-Storage and consent round-trip need the live `b40-documents`
  bucket — folded into the browser smoke-test carry-forward.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 5a (2026-05-22)

Document vault + referee + e-consent (backend; frontend is 5b).

### Added
- **`ApplicantDocument`, `Referee`, `Consent` models** (migration 0004; all RLS deny-by-default).
- **`storage.py`** — signed upload/download URLs for a private Supabase Storage bucket
  (`b40-documents`) via stdlib `urllib` + the service key; file bytes go browser↔Storage, never
  through Django. Best-effort (returns None on failure).
- **Endpoints** (scoped to the caller's shortlisted application): `documents/sign-upload/`,
  `documents/` (list/record), `documents/<id>/` (delete), `referees/`, `consent/`.
- **Consent + guardian gate** — versioned (`CONSENT_VERSION`), withdrawable, supersedes prior; a
  **minor (<18, age from NRIC DOB) requires a guardian** (name + relationship) or consent is rejected.
- `age_from_nric` / `is_minor` / `record_consent` services.

### Tests
- 18 new (`test_consent.py` 9, `test_documents.py` 9). Full backend suite **1077 pass, 0 fail**;
  golden masters unchanged.

### Notes
- Two deploy carry-forwards: create the `b40-documents` private bucket; replace the DRAFT consent
  text (`CONSENT_VERSION = '2026-draft-1'`) with the lawyer-reviewed version.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 4b (2026-05-21)

Post-shortlist next-steps flow (frontend) — completes Sprint 4.

### Added
- **`ScholarshipNextSteps` component** — a 3-step checklist driven by the `completeness` block:
  course quiz (links to the existing `/quiz`), about-you textareas, and a funding-need line-item
  form with a live RM total. PATCHes to the Sprint 4a details endpoint; "all done" banner on completion.
- Shortlisted applications on `/scholarship/apply` now render this flow (rejected/submitted keep
  the status card).
- `scholarship.ts` helpers: `fundingTotal`, `buildDetailsPayload`, `applicationToDetailsForm`,
  `emptyDetailsForm`.
- API: extended `ScholarshipApplication` type (`funding_need`, `completeness`, deeper-info) +
  `updateScholarshipDetails()` PATCH.
- i18n: `scholarship.nextSteps.*` in EN/MS/TA (819 keys, parity verified).

### Tests
- 5 new helper tests (frontend suite **35 pass**); check-i18n PASS; `next build` success.

### Notes
- Verified at compile + unit + i18n level; the PATCH round-trip + quiz-then-return flow need a
  browser smoke test against a live backend before Phase 1 ships (existing carry-forward).

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 4a (2026-05-21)

Post-shortlist data layer: funding need + deeper info + completeness (backend; frontend is 4b).

### Added
- **`FundingNeed` model** (OneToOne → application, `funding_needs`) — line items (tuition_gap,
  laptop, hostel, transport, books, monthly_allowance × allowance_months, other, other_desc) + a
  computed `total`. Quantifies the funding ask (the B40 analysis flagged its absence).
- **Deeper-info fields** on `ScholarshipApplication`: `aspirations`, `plans`, `fears`, `justification`.
- **`PATCH /api/v1/scholarship/applications/<id>/`** — saves deeper-info + funding need for the
  caller's own **shortlisted** application; read serializer now returns `funding_need` + a
  `completeness` block (`quiz_done` / `details_done` / `funding_done` / `complete`).
- `application_completeness()` + `save_application_details()` services. Migration 0003.
- `funding_needs` added to the deny-by-default RLS SQL.

### Tests
- 11 new (`test_details.py`). Full backend suite **1059 pass, 0 fail**; golden masters unchanged.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 3 (2026-05-21)

Mechanical shortlisting engine + Bucket A/B + pass/fail decision emails.

### Added
- **`apps/scholarship/shortlisting.py`** — pure `evaluate(app, cohort)` → status/bucket/reason.
  Per-criterion OK/marginal/fail across academic (A-count or PNGK), income (STR anchor + ceiling
  × 1.15 marginal band), intent and consent. All-OK → Bucket A; exactly one marginal → Bucket B;
  otherwise rejected. All thresholds read from `ScholarshipCohort`.
- **`shortlist_application()`** wired into the intake view — runs synchronously on submit, persists
  status/bucket/reason/shortlisted_at, sends the pass email immediately.
- **Trilingual pass + fail emails** (refactored `emails.py` onto a shared `_send` helper).
- **`send_pending_decision_emails` management command** — sends the courteous "not this round"
  email after `fail_email_delay_days`; `--dry-run`, prints the DB host, reads config from settings.
- Model fields `shortlisted_at`, `decision_email_sent_at`, `locale`, `notify_email` (migration 0002).

### Changed
- Submitting now triggers an instant shortlist: a qualifying applicant receives the acknowledgement
  *and* a congratulations email; a rejected applicant receives only the acknowledgement, with the
  fail email deferred to the command after the cohort delay.

### Tests
- 25 new (`test_shortlisting.py` 19, `test_decision_emails.py` 6) + updated intake tests. Full
  backend suite **1048 pass, 0 fail**; SPM/STPM golden masters unchanged.

### Notes
- The fail-email command's scheduler (e.g. Cloud Scheduler) is not yet wired — deploy work,
  deferred with the Supabase migration/RLS to the end of Phase 1.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 2 (2026-05-21)

Native application form + single front door (frontend), wired to the Sprint 1 intake API.

### Added
- **`/scholarship/apply` page** — trilingual application form with a requirements intro and
  status-gated rendering (loading / sign-in gate / form / success / already-applied), pre-filled
  from the AuthProvider profile. Lightweight academic capture (SPM A-count or STPM PNGK); full
  grades + quiz stay deferred to STEP 1A.
- **`src/lib/scholarship.ts`** — pure, node-testable helpers (`countAGrades`,
  `profileToApplyDefaults`, `buildApplicationPayload`, `applyFormError`).
- **API client** — `submitScholarshipApplication` + `getMyScholarshipApplications`.
- **`'apply'` auth-gate reason** — new branch in `auth-context` + `AuthGateModal` that reuses the
  existing Google sign-in + NRIC-claim flow and returns the user to `/scholarship/apply`.
- **"B40 Aid" header nav link.**
- **i18n** — `scholarship.*` block + `authGate.applyReason` in EN/MS/TA (793 keys, parity verified).

### Tests
- 13 new (`src/lib/__tests__/scholarship.test.ts`); full frontend suite **30 pass** (17 + 13).
- check-i18n PASS; `next build` success (`/scholarship/apply` compiles + prerenders).

### Notes
- Verified at compile + unit + i18n level. The OAuth round-trip (sign-in → return to apply) has
  not been browser-smoke-tested against a live backend — do so before Phase 1 ships.

## [Unreleased] — B40 Assistance Programme · Phase 1 Sprint 1 (2026-05-21)

New `apps/scholarship/` app — the financing extension's intake backbone. Phase 1 carries
no sponsor or money flow (those are Phases 2-3). See `docs/scholarship/b40-assistance-prd.md`
and `docs/scholarship/b40-phase1-roadmap.md`.

### Added
- **`ScholarshipCohort` model** (`scholarship_cohorts`) — per-round config holding the
  configurable shortlisting thresholds (`min_spm_a_count`, `min_stpm_pngk`, `income_ceiling`,
  `bucket_b_margin`) and funding/workflow parameters (`funding_envelope`, `fail_email_delay_days`)
  that the Sprint 3 rules engine will read.
- **`ScholarshipApplication` model** (`scholarship_applications`) — one application per student
  per cohort (partial unique constraint), with explicit shortlisting inputs (qualification,
  spm_a_count, stpm_pngk, household_income/size, receives_str/jkm, intended_pathway,
  intends_tertiary_2026, consent_to_contact), workflow fields (status, bucket, shortlist_reason,
  acknowledged_at) and a free-form `form_data` blob.
- **Intake API** — `GET/POST /api/v1/scholarship/applications/` (list own + submit) and
  `GET /api/v1/scholarship/applications/<id>/` (own detail). Submit resolves the active open
  cohort, snapshots the SPM A-count from the linked `StudentProfile` (A+/A/A- all count), sends
  a trilingual acknowledgement email, and stamps `acknowledged_at`. Default-deny auth; anonymous
  users and the duplicate/closed-round cases are rejected (403/409).
- **Trilingual acknowledgement email** (EN/MS/TA) via the existing Gmail SMTP infra; best-effort
  send that never blocks recording the application.
- **RLS policy SQL** (`apps/scholarship/sql/rls_policies.sql`) — enables RLS deny-by-default on
  both new tables (Django service role bypasses; direct PostgREST access denied). Apply before
  first deploy, then confirm Security Advisor 0 errors.

### Tests
- 17 new tests (`apps/scholarship/tests/`): models + defaults + partial-unique constraint +
  A-count helper (test_models.py, 4); intake create/ack-email/snapshot/consent/duplicate/
  closed-round/anonymous/no-profile/list-own/detail/cross-user-404/auth (test_api.py, 13).
- Full backend suite: **1023 passed, 0 failures** (1006 existing + 17 new); SPM/STPM golden
  masters unchanged.

### Notes
- Backend only — the native application form (frontend) is Sprint 2.
- Comms via email + in-app for Phase 1; WhatsApp deferred to Phase 2.

## [Unreleased] — Admin CSV Full Field Set (2026-05-02)

### Changed
- **Partner admin CSV export expanded from 7 columns to 27** (`/api/v1/admin/students/export/`). Now carries every field admins see in the dashboard detail view: identity (Name, IC, Angka Giliran, Email, Phone, School), demographics (Gender, Nationality), address (Address, Postal Code, City, State), eligibility context (Family Income, Siblings, Colorblind, Disability), academic (Exam Type, SPM Grades, STPM Grades, STPM CGPA, MUET Band), preferences (Financial Pressure, Travel Willingness), attribution (Referral Source, Referred By Org), and timestamps (Date Joined, Last Sign-In).
- `_fetch_auth_emails` → `_fetch_auth_data`: now fetches `last_sign_in_at` alongside `email` from `auth.users` in the same query.
- Export queryset now uses `select_related('referred_by_org')` to avoid N+1 lookups for the org-name column.

### Added
- **`Email` and `Last Sign-In` columns** joined from Supabase Auth's `auth.users` by `supabase_user_id`. Anonymous-only users (no email or phone) appear as blank in those columns; everyone else has them populated.
- JSON fields (SPM Grades, STPM Grades) are compactly stringified; empty `{}` renders as blank.
- Booleans render as `Yes`/`No` for human readability.

### Tests
- 5 tests in `apps/courses/tests/test_admin_export.py`: full 27-column header, full SPM profile rendering, STPM-specific columns, ghost-row blank rendering, auth-query-failure fallback.

---

## [2.0-rc] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- **OpenAI GPT-4o Mini fallback** for AI report generation when all Gemini models fail.
- **GCP cost monitoring**: RM50/month budget alert, BigQuery billing export.

---

## [Unreleased] — Auth Flow Canonical Refactor (2026-03-20)

### Changed
- **AuthProvider is single routing authority**: `status` + `profile` live in React context. Routing reads AuthProvider, never localStorage directly.
- **localStorage is write-only cache**: AuthProvider fetches from API, writes to localStorage as cache. `profile-restore.ts` deleted.
- **Callback page simplified**: Just establishes session, delegates all routing to AuthProvider status machine.
- **AuthGateModal reads context**: No more standalone `getProfile()` calls — reads `status`/`profile` from AuthProvider.
- **useOnboardingGuard reads AuthProvider**: Guards use AuthProvider state with loading support, not localStorage.
- **IC page guard reads status from AuthProvider**: Redirects if anonymous or already has NRIC.
- **STPM fields added to StudentProfile TS type**: Cached in AuthProvider alongside SPM fields.
- **Dashboard ranked results flattened to single list**: Removed dual-list display.

### Fixed
- **Rules of Hooks crash**: Moved `pendingProfileRedirect` useEffect before early return.
- **Onboarding redirect loop**: Resolved empty profile creation causing infinite redirects.
- **OAuth amnesia**: Stopped premature profile creation; fixed `signInWithGoogle` vs `linkIdentity` for login.
- **IC format**: Hyphens inserted before API call; loading race condition fixed.

### Removed
- `profile-restore.ts` — AuthProvider handles caching.
- TD-003 — auth flow refactored, localStorage no longer routing authority.

### Docs
- Comprehensive auth/onboarding flow documentation (`docs/auth-onboarding-flow.md`).
- Sprint retrospective, decisions, lessons.

### Tests
- 966 backend tests, 17 frontend, 0 failures.

---

## [Unreleased] — W14+W21 Ranking Sprint (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **W14**: 5-level STPM sort tiebreaking — score → uni tier → min_cgpa → difficulty → name.
- **W21**: `TRACK_FIELD_MAP` — matric:sains + stpm:sains → health + agriculture.
- 8 new tests.

---

## [Unreleased] — NRIC Hard Gate Sprint (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **Anonymous sign-in**: Auto-sign-in anonymously on first visit via Supabase; `isAnonymous` flag in AuthProvider.
- **linkIdentity helpers**: For upgrading anonymous sessions to Google-linked accounts.
- **NRIC hard gate middleware**: Blocks protected endpoints without NRIC — returns 403 `nric_required`.
- **Auth gate rewrite**: NRIC-first identity flow with `linkIdentity()`, replaces login page with redirect.
- **403 handler**: Frontend auto-shows auth gate on `nric_required` response.
- **Header updates**: Different UI for anonymous vs identified users.
- **IC page guard**: Redirect if anonymous or already has NRIC.
- 18 new integration tests for NRIC hard gate flow.

### Changed
- `isAuthenticated` now means has-NRIC; `hasSession` added as separate flag.
- Removed `get_or_create` from protected views — profiles must exist via NRIC claim.
- `is_anonymous` extracted from JWT in auth middleware.
- Course display limit unified to 9; explore filters sorted alphabetically.

---

## [Unreleased] — W7 FIELD_KEY_MAP Sprint (2026-03-20)

### Added
- 7 new `field_key` → signal mappings in `FIELD_KEY_MAP`.
- Search filter alphabetical sort.
- 8 new tests.

---

## [Unreleased] — Ranking Improvements Sprint (2026-03-19)

### Changed
- **W4**: 73 PISMP course tags backfilled for ranking accuracy.
- **W11**: STPM pre-quiz RIASEC signal derived from subjects (no quiz needed).
- Ranking audit doc added.
- W16 resolved.

### Fixed
- localStorage restoration from Supabase on login.
- Frontend boolean conversion — stopped converting booleans to Ya/Tidak before API calls.
- localStorage migration for legacy Ya/Tidak strings.

### Tests
- 40 new tests.

---

## [Unreleased] — i18n Sprint 2: Admin Pages (2026-03-19)

### Changed
- **All 7 admin pages internationalised**: 118 keys × 3 languages (EN/MS/TA).
- Zero hardcoded admin strings remaining.

---

## [Unreleased] — i18n & Bug Fixes Sprint (2026-03-19)

### Changed
- **BooleanField conversion**: `colorblind`/`disability` CharField → BooleanField (fixes dashboard 400 bug). Migration 0046.
- **Error mapping layer**: `ERROR_MAP` + `PATTERN_MAP` for i18n error translation.
- **Trilingual email verification**: EN/MS/TA templates.
- **Dynamic HTML lang attribute**: Set from locale.
- **Translated aria-labels**: Accessibility i18n.

### Fixed
- Dashboard 400 error from boolean field type mismatch.
- Hardcoded strings in auth callback, quiz, report, and IC onboarding pages replaced with `t()` calls.
- Stats display, login button, and incomplete badge UI fixes.

### Tests
- 4 new tests.

---

## [Unreleased] — STPM Quiz Sprint 5: Deploy & Validate (2026-03-18)

### Changed
- **Migrations 0042-0045 applied to Supabase**: MUET float type, postal_code/city/address profile fields, RIASEC/difficulty/efficacy enrichment fields, is_active flag — all applied via raw SQL (bypassing InconsistentMigrationHistory blocker).
- **RIASEC enrichment applied to production**: 867 STPM courses + 28 field taxonomy entries enriched with riasec_type, difficulty_level, efficacy_domain via `enrich_stpm_riasec --apply`.
- **Backend deployed**: `halatuju-api-00131-p7l` on Cloud Run asia-southeast1.
- **Frontend deployed**: `halatuju-web-00160-rql` on Cloud Run asia-southeast1.

### Verified
- Supabase Security Advisor: 0 new issues after schema changes.
- Smoke tests: STPM quiz questions (branch routing), quiz submit (signal accumulation), eligibility check (545 courses for strong science student), all passing on production.

## [Unreleased] — STPM Quiz Engine Sprint 4: Frontend (2026-03-18)

### Added
- **STPM quiz page** (`halatuju-web/src/app/stpm/quiz/page.tsx`): Branching card-based quiz UI with dynamic Q3/Q4 resolution after Q2. Reads subjects from localStorage, routes Science/Arts/Mixed branches via backend API, auto-advances between questions.
- **STPM quiz API client** (`halatuju-web/src/lib/api.ts`): 3 functions — `getStpmQuizQuestions`, `resolveStpmQuizQ3Q4`, `submitStpmQuiz` — plus `StpmResultFraming` type for ranking response framing.
- **Subject-to-API key mapping** (`halatuju-web/src/lib/subjects.ts`): `STPM_SUBJECT_TO_API_KEY` maps 20 frontend subject IDs (e.g. `PHYSICS`) to backend keys (e.g. `physics`).
- **STPM quiz storage keys** (`halatuju-web/src/lib/storage.ts`): `KEY_STPM_QUIZ_SIGNALS`, `KEY_STPM_QUIZ_BRANCH` for persisting quiz results across sessions.
- **Trilingual STPM quiz strings** (`messages/en.json`, `ms.json`, `ta.json`): Loading, error, skip, take/retake quiz labels.

### Changed
- **Dashboard shows quiz-informed framing** (`halatuju-web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`): When STPM quiz signals exist, dashboard header shows result framing (confirmatory/guided/discovery heading + subtitle). Quiz CTA routes to `/stpm/quiz`. Retake button shown after quiz completion.
- **Dashboard reads STPM quiz signals** (`dashboard/page.tsx`): STPM ranking now uses `KEY_STPM_QUIZ_SIGNALS` (falling back to `KEY_QUIZ_SIGNALS`), and displays framing from ranking API response.

## [Unreleased] — STPM Quiz Engine Sprint 3: Ranking Integration (2026-03-18)

### Changed
- **STPM ranking formula rewritten** (`stpm_ranking.py`): 7-component scoring — BASE(50) + CGPA_MARGIN(+20) + FIELD_MATCH(+12) + RIASEC_ALIGNMENT(+8) + EFFICACY_MODIFIER(+4/-2) + GOAL_ALIGNMENT(+4) - INTERVIEW(-3) - RESILIENCE_DISCOUNT(0/-3). Max score 98.
- **Eligibility output enriched** (`stpm_engine.py`): Eligible course dicts now include `riasec_type`, `difficulty_level`, `efficacy_domain` for ranking engine consumption
- **Ranking API returns framing** (`views.py`): `POST /stpm/ranking/` now includes `framing` object with mode (confirmatory/guided/discovery), heading, and subtitle from Q1 crystallisation signal

### Added
- **Result framing logic**: 3 modes based on Q1 — confirmatory ("Your profile aligns with..."), guided ("Based on your interests..."), discovery ("Here are fields worth exploring")
- **STPM field_key → field_interest reverse mapping** (`_FK_TO_INTEREST`): Maps Q3 sub-field signals back to Q2 broad interest for secondary field matching

### Tests
- 58 ranking tests (was 11): CGPA margin (5), field match (9), RIASEC alignment (8), efficacy modifier (6), goal alignment (7), resilience discount (7), interview (2), full integration (4), framing (5), ranked results (5)
- 881 backend tests, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=2026 (unchanged)

## [Unreleased] — STPM Quiz Engine Sprint 2: Data Enrichment (2026-03-18)

### Added
- **3 new fields on StpmCourse**: `riasec_type` (R/I/A/S/E/C), `difficulty_level` (low/moderate/high), `efficacy_domain` (quantitative/scientific/verbal/practical) — for quiz-informed ranking in Sprint 3
- **`riasec_primary` field on FieldTaxonomy**: maps each field to its primary Holland RIASEC type
- **`enrich_stpm_riasec` management command**: deterministic classifier using field_key → RIASEC/difficulty/efficacy mappings from the design doc. Covers 37 field_keys (all except `umum` catch-all). Dry-run by default, `--apply` to save.
- **Migration 0044**: `add_riasec_difficulty_efficacy_fields`

### Tests
- 40 new enrichment tests (mapping completeness, correctness, consistency, DB fields, management command)
- 829 backend tests, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=2026 (unchanged)

## [Unreleased] — STPM Quiz Engine Sprint 1: Foundation (2026-03-18)

### Added
- **STPM quiz data** (`stpm_quiz_data.py`): ~35 questions × 3 languages (EN/BM/TA) with subject-seeded branching design grounded in Holland's RIASEC, SCCT, SDT, and Super's Career Development Theory
- **STPM quiz engine** (`stpm_quiz_engine.py`): RIASEC seed calculation from STPM subjects, branch routing (Science/Arts/Mixed), grade-adaptive Q4 resolution, cross-domain Q5 stream filtering, signal accumulation into 9-category taxonomy
- **3 new API endpoints**: `GET /stpm/quiz/questions/` (returns branch-specific questions), `POST /stpm/quiz/resolve/` (resolves Q3+Q4 after Q2 answer), `POST /stpm/quiz/submit/` (processes answers → signals)
- **STPM signal taxonomy**: 9 categories (riasec_seed, field_interest, field_key, cross_domain, efficacy, resilience, motivation, career_goal, context)
- **Cross-domain asymmetry enforcement**: Science students see 6 Q5 options; arts students see only achievable options (no science-prerequisite programmes)
- **Grade-adaptive confidence check**: Q4 uses actual STPM grades — weak grades (≤B-) trigger honest framing, strong grades trigger confirmatory framing

### Tests
- 102 new STPM quiz tests (56 engine + 22 data + 24 API)
- 775 backend tests, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=2026 (unchanged)

## [Unreleased] — STPM Requirements Pipeline Rebuild Sprint 3: Validator + Workflow (2026-03-17)

### Added
- **Validator tool** (`Settings/_tools/stpm_requirements/validate_stpm_requirements.py`): 6 automated quality checks — completeness, subject key validity (validates against canonical key sets), grade validity, count sanity, cross-reference with source CSV, sample audit against raw HTML
- **Reusable workflow** (`Settings/_workflows/stpm-requirements-update.md`): Annual STPM requirements refresh SOP covering all 5 pipeline stages with checkpoints and failure modes

### Fixed
- Validator subject key check now catches invalid keys beyond `UNKNOWN:` prefix (validates against `VALID_STPM_KEYS`/`VALID_SPM_KEYS` sets)
- Validator handles `stpm_named_subjects` as list of dicts (real data format), not just list of strings
- Validator CSV cross-reference gracefully handles missing files instead of crashing
- Validator sample audit uses isolated PRNG (`random.Random(42)`) instead of global seed

### Tests
- 49 new validator tests (248 total pipeline tool tests)
- 590 backend tests, 17 frontend tests, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=2103

## [Unreleased] — STPM Requirements Pipeline Rebuild Sprint 2: Backend Integration (2026-03-16)

### Added
- **Fixture converter** (`Settings/_tools/stpm_requirements/stpm_json_to_fixture.py`): Converts structured JSON → Django fixture format with null-safety for non-nullable model fields
- **4 new StpmRequirement boolean fields**: `req_male`, `req_female`, `single`, `no_disability` (migration 0031)
- **List-aware subject group engine**: `check_stpm_subject_group()` and `check_spm_prerequisites()` now handle both single dict (legacy) and list of dicts (new pipeline) formats with AND semantics
- **Exclusion list support**: SPM prerequisites engine checks `exclude` lists — student needs min_count subjects at min_grade from any subject NOT in the exclude list
- **Demographic eligibility checks**: `check_stpm_eligibility()` now enforces `req_male`, `req_female`, `no_disability`
- **API fields**: STPM course detail response includes `req_male`, `req_female`, `single`, `no_disability`
- **SpecialConditions component**: Renders gender, marital, disability conditions with colour-coded indicators
- **i18n keys**: `maleOnly`, `femaleOnly`, `unmarriedOnly`, `noDisability` in EN/MS/TA
- **Search page fix**: SPM grades merged from `KEY_GRADES` into profile for eligibility checks
- **Dashboard fix**: Report existence synced with DB on fresh devices

### Changed
- **STPM golden master**: 1811 → 2103 (richer requirement data = more eligible matches)
- **stpm_requirements.json fixture**: Regenerated from new pipeline (1,113 courses)

### Tests
- 32 new fixture converter tests (199 total pipeline tool tests)
- 590 backend tests, 17 frontend tests, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=2103

## [Unreleased] — STPM Requirements Pipeline Rebuild Sprint 1: Parser Rewrite (2026-03-16)

### Added
- **Subject key registry** (`Settings/_tools/stpm_requirements/subject_keys.py`): 135+ subject mappings (25 STPM + 110 SPM), slash-combo handling, `UNKNOWN:` fallback
- **HTML→JSON parser** (`Settings/_tools/stpm_requirements/parse_stpm_html.py`): Per-`<li>` block parsing via BeautifulSoup, 11 block types, multi-tier STPM groups, exclusion lists
- **Pipeline test suite**: 167 tests (subject keys + parser + integration)
- Parsed 1,680 courses (1,003 science + 677 arts): 1.4% warning rate, 0 unknown subjects

## [Unreleased] — MASCO Career Mappings Sprint B: AI Mapping Pipeline (2026-03-16)

### Added
- **FIELD_KEY_TO_MASCO mapping**: Deterministic mapping from 31 field_keys to MASCO 2-digit occupation groups for pre-filtering
- **filter_masco_by_field_key**: Filters 4,854 MASCO jobs to ~200-400 relevant jobs per field
- **map_course_careers command**: AI-assisted career mapping pipeline
  - Generate mode (`--output`): iterates unmapped courses, calls Gemini, outputs review CSV
  - Apply mode (`--apply`): reads reviewed CSV, writes M2M links to DB
  - Supports both SPM (`--source-type`) and STPM (`--stpm`) courses
  - Rate limiting (`--delay`), batch size (`--limit`), Gemini model cascade

### Tests
- 12 new tests (5 mapping, 3 filter, 2 generate, 2 apply)
- Total: 568 backend + 17 frontend, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=1811 (unchanged)

## [Unreleased] — MASCO Career Mappings Sprint A: Backend Foundation (2026-03-16)

### Added
- **Full MASCO 2020 dataset**: `load_masco_full` management command loads 4,854 occupations from CSV with auto-generated eMASCO URLs (`https://emasco.mohr.gov.my/masco/{code}`)
- **StpmCourse.career_occupations**: New M2M field mirrors SPM `Course` model — STPM degree courses can now link to MASCO job codes
- **STPM detail API**: Now returns `career_occupations` array (same shape as SPM detail)
- **CareerPathways component**: Extracted from SPM detail page into shared component used by both SPM and STPM course detail pages; jobs with `emasco_url` are clickable, without are plain tags; hidden when empty

### Tests
- 10 new tests (4 data loading, 3 model, 3 API)
- Total: 556 backend + 17 frontend, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=1811 (unchanged — no eligibility/ranking changes)

## [Unreleased] — Field Taxonomy Sprint 5: Cleanup & Legacy Removal (2026-03-16)

### Changed
- **`field_key` non-nullable** — both `Course` and `StpmCourse` now require `field_key` (was nullable); all 1,503 courses already populated
- **Frontend field fallbacks** — all `course.field` references replaced with `getFieldName(course.field_key)` from taxonomy hook (detail pages, saved page, CourseCard)
- **Search API** — removed `?field=` fallback from frontend; only `field_key` sent

### Removed
- `frontend_label` column from `Course` model (migration 0028)
- `category` column from `StpmCourse` model (migration 0029)
- `frontend_label` from `CourseSerializer` output and TypeScript `Course` type
- `field` from `SearchParams` TypeScript type

### Tests
- Total: 530 backend + 17 frontend, 0 failures
- Golden masters: SPM=5319, STPM=1811 (unchanged)

## [Unreleased] — Field Taxonomy Sprint 4: Frontend Integration (2026-03-16)

### Changed
- **CourseCard images** — replaced 150-line `getImageSlug()` keyword matcher with taxonomy-driven lookup via `field_key` → `image_slug`; images now resolve from `FieldTaxonomy.image_slug` instead of hardcoded keyword rules
- **Search field filter** — dropdown now uses `/api/v1/fields/` taxonomy API with trilingual labels (EN/MS/TA) and filters by `field_key` instead of raw `frontend_label`/`field` strings
- **Search API** — `?field_key=` parameter now preferred over `?field=` for filtering; `field_keys` list added to search filter response
- **Dashboard** — STPM course cards now pass `field_key` through to CourseCard for correct image resolution

### Added
- `useFieldTaxonomy` hook — fetches taxonomy once, caches module-level, provides `getImageUrl(fieldKey)` and `getFieldName(fieldKey)` for trilingual field labels
- `fetchFieldTaxonomy()` API client function for `/api/v1/fields/`
- `field_key` added to `EligibleCourse`, `SearchCourse`, `StpmEligibleCourse` TypeScript types
- 2 new backend tests: `field_key` filter, `field_keys` in search filters

### Tests
- Total: 546 backend + 17 frontend, 0 failures

## [Unreleased] — Field Taxonomy Sprint 3: Ranking Engine field_key Integration (2026-03-16)

### Changed
- **SPM ranking** — field interest matching now uses `field_key` (taxonomy key) instead of `frontend_label` strings; `FIELD_LABEL_MAP` replaced by `FIELD_KEY_MAP`
- **STPM ranking** — keyword-based `_match_field_interest()` replaced with `field_key` lookup against shared `FIELD_KEY_MAP` (DRY); removed 48-line `COURSE_FIELD_MAP`
- **`field_health` signal** — now correctly maps to health fields (`perubatan`, `farmasi`, `sains-hayat`) instead of agriculture (was a bug)
- **`field_key` in eligibility results** — added to both SPM and STPM eligibility response dicts so ranking engines can use it

### Tests
- Updated 7 field interest tests (5 SPM, 2 STPM) from `frontend_label`/keyword to `field_key`
- Added 3 new tests: double-match bonus, no-field_key edge case (SPM + STPM)
- Total: 544 tests, 0 failures

---

## [Unreleased] — Field Taxonomy Sprint 2: STPM Classification + API Integration (2026-03-16)

### Added
- **STPM deterministic classifier** — `classify_stpm_course()` maps `category + field + course_name` to taxonomy key; handles ~170 category values across 29 taxonomy keys
- **`_classify_spm_matching()` helper** — sub-classifies 10 SPM-matching STPM categories using `course_name` (STPM field == category aggregate, not specific sub-discipline)
- **`FieldTaxonomySerializer`** — recursive serializer with `children` field for nested group→leaf structure
- **`GET /api/v1/fields/`** — returns 10 field groups with nested children (37 leaf fields)
- **`?field_key=` filter** — backwards-compatible query parameter on search endpoints (alongside existing `?field=`)
- **`field_key` in API responses** — added to SPM search, STPM search, and STPM course detail
- **`classify_stpm_fields` management command** — dry-run/save modes, distribution summary, safety checks
- **57 new STPM classifier tests** + 4 API endpoint tests (total 118 in test_field_taxonomy.py)
- **SQL reference script** — `scripts/stpm_backfill_field_key.sql` for documentation

### Database
- Backfilled all 1,113/1,113 STPM courses with `field_key_id` (0 unclassified)
- Distribution: 29 of 37 taxonomy keys used (top: pertanian=100, pendidikan=97, umum=77, sains-hayat=65, it-perisian=65)

---

## [Unreleased] — Field Taxonomy Sprint 1: Model + Migration + SPM Backfill (2026-03-16)

### Added
- **FieldTaxonomy model** — canonical table with 37 leaf fields + 10 parent groups, trilingual names (EN/MS/TA), image slugs, parent-child hierarchy
- **field_key FK** on `Course` and `StpmCourse` — nullable foreign key to FieldTaxonomy (will become non-nullable in Sprint 5)
- **Data migration** — populates all 47 taxonomy entries with trilingual names and sort orders
- **Deterministic classifier** — `classify_course()` maps `frontend_label + field + course_name` to taxonomy key; handles 16 production frontend_label variants
- **Backfill management command** — `backfill_spm_field_key` with `--save` flag (dry-run by default), safety check for PostgreSQL
- **Admin registration** — FieldTaxonomyAdmin with list/filter/search; CourseAdmin updated with field_key display/filter
- **55 new tests** — 7 model integrity tests + 48 classifier tests (including 24 production frontend_label tests)

### Database
- Created `field_taxonomy` table (47 entries) with RLS enabled (public read)
- Added `field_key_id` column to `courses` and `stpm_courses`
- Backfilled all 390 SPM courses (0 unmapped)
- Recorded Django migrations 0025 + 0026

---

## [Unreleased] — Special Conditions, Report Guard & Search Fix (2026-03-15)

### Added
- **Special Conditions expansion** — SpecialConditions component now shows gender restrictions (male/female only), unmarried requirement, and no-disability condition with colour-coded dots (blue/pink/purple/red)
- **i18n keys** — `maleOnly`, `femaleOnly`, `unmarriedOnly`, `noDisability` in EN/MS/TA
- **Contact form** — Supabase-backed contact form replaces raw email on contact page (name, email/phone, category, message)
- **Onboarding guard** — `useOnboardingGuard` hook protects dashboard/saved/profile/outcomes from users without grades
- **IC gate** — post-login IC + name collection page for users without NRIC
- **Smart auth routing** — Google OAuth and OTP login check NRIC → grades → route appropriately
- **Profile redesign** — two-column layout, amber incomplete indicators, email/phone/angka giliran fields, Yes/No toggles

### Fixed
- **Search "Eligible only" broken** — grades stored in `KEY_GRADES` but search page only read `KEY_PROFILE`; now merges both (root cause of 0 results)
- **"Generate Report" shown alongside "Read Report"** — syncs `reportGenerated` state from DB when localStorage flag missing (cross-device/cache clear)
- **Profile i18n bug** — `onboarding.name` key replaced with `profile.name` in all 3 languages
- **Mobile nav auth gate** — uses `link.authReason` instead of hardcoded `'profile'`

### Database
- Set `single = true` for 4 courses (IKBN-CET-005, UZ0520001, UZ0345001, UZ0721001) — recovered from deleted `details.csv`
- Created `contact_submissions` table with RLS (anon insert, service_role manage)

---

## [Unreleased] — Tech Debt Quick Wins 2 (2026-03-15)

### Added
- **Trilingual pre-U descriptions** — i18n keys (EN/MS/TA) for all 6 pre-U course headlines and descriptions in message files, replacing empty DB fields
- **Gemini API rate limiting** — max 3 reports per user per 24 hours via Django cache, returns 429 when exceeded (TD-009)
- **CourseListView pagination** — optional `?page=1&page_size=50` query params, backwards-compatible (TD-046)
- **Fallback description template** — `courses.descriptionFallback` i18n key replaces hardcoded fallback strings in course detail page

### Fixed
- **Engine field naming** — `three_m_only` used directly instead of runtime column rename hack in `apps.py` (TD-023)
- **Bug 4** — reclassified as "not a bug" (pre-U entry requirements are genuinely broad, not generic)
- **Bug 5** — pre-U description content added via i18n system (proper trilingual approach)

### Changed
- **Dependency pins relaxed** — `sentry-sdk>=1.39,<3.0` (was `<2.0`), `numpy>=1.24,<3.0` (was `<2.0`) (TD-039, TD-040)
- **Tech debt doc** — updated 10 items to reflect resolved status (5 from earlier sprints not marked, 5 new). Now 48/52 resolved.

---

## [Unreleased] — Bug Fixes & Auth Gating (2026-03-15)

### Added
- **Centralised localStorage keys** — `storage.ts` with 19 key constants + `clearAll()` helper, all 15 pages updated (TD-014 resolved)
- **Auth gating** — My Profile nav link, Load More buttons (dashboard SPM/STPM/ranked + search), and profile page now show sign-up modal for anon users
- **Saved courses UX** — institution name + course ID on saved cards, unified status toggle with correct state transitions (un-toggle "Got Offer" falls back to "Applied")
- **Error boundary pages** — `error.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` for graceful error handling
- **Backend** — `institution_name` returned for both SPM and STPM saved courses
- **i18n** — `profileReason`, `loadmoreReason` auth gate messages in EN/MS/TA; error/loading/not-found page keys

### Changed
- About page tagline: removed "No sign-ups" (all 3 languages) since sign-up is now required for key features

---

## [Unreleased] — Saved Courses Sprint 2 (2026-03-15)

### Added
- **`useSavedCourses()` shared hook** — single source of truth for save state, auth gating, optimistic updates, toast feedback, and resume-after-login across all pages
- **Toast notification system** — `ToastProvider` + `useToast()` hook with success/error variants, auto-dismiss after 3s, slide-in animation
- **Search page save** — bookmark icon on search results now reflects actual saved state and toggles correctly
- **Detail page visual states** — save button shows green "Saved" when saved, red "Remove from Saved" on hover, blue "Save This Course" when not saved (both SPM and STPM detail pages)
- **Saved page SPM/STPM tabs** — tabbed interface with counts, correct detail page links per type (`/course/` for SPM, `/stpm/` for STPM)

## [Unreleased] — Saved Courses Sprint 1 (2026-03-15)

### Added
- **STPM course saving** — SavedCourse model supports both SPM and STPM courses via dual nullable FKs with DB check constraint
- **Qualification filter** — `GET /saved-courses/?qualification=SPM|STPM` filters saved courses by type
- **Auto-detect STPM** — POST with `stpm-*` prefix or explicit `course_type` saves to correct FK
- **`course_type` in response** — GET /saved-courses/ returns `course_type: 'spm' | 'stpm'` per entry
- **Frontend types** — `SavedCourseWithStatus.course_type`, `saveCourse` accepts optional `courseType`, `getSavedCourses` accepts optional `qualification` filter

### Changed
- **SavedCourse model** — `course` FK now nullable, `stpm_course` FK added, `unique_together` replaced with partial unique indexes
- **SavedCourseDetailView** — DELETE/PATCH check both FKs when looking up saved course

### Database
- Supabase migration: `stpm_course_id` column, nullable `course_id`, check constraint, partial unique indexes

### Tests
- Saved courses tests expanded from 3 to 17 (SPM CRUD, STPM CRUD, qualification filter, idempotent save, check constraint enforcement)
- Full suite: 425 pass, 0 fail, 0 skip

### Added
- **MOHE ePanduan integration** — `mohe_url` field on StpmCourse, auto-generated URL pattern for 1,113 STPM courses, validated with Selenium-based page content checker
- **MOHE scraper + sync** — `scrape_mohe_courses` and `sync_stpm_mohe` management commands for auditing MOHE catalogue against DB
- **STPM URL validator** — Selenium-based validator (not HTTP status — MOHE always returns 200). Checks rendered page content for "daripada 0 carian" to detect dead links
- **Course-level "More Info" pill** — About section on course detail pages now shows a contextual "More Info" link: MOHE ePanduan for UA/poly/kkom, polycc for poly (TBD), MOE sites for matric/form 6/PISMP, institution hyperlink for TVET
- **Institution website links** — Institution cards now link to the institution's own website URL instead of the course-level hyperlink
- **STPM institution cards** — Rich institution card on STPM detail page with acronym, type, category, state, and website link (looked up from Institution table)
- **ILJTM/ILKBS filter split** — Search API resolves `tvet` source_type into `iljtm`/`ilkbs` using `course_pathway_map`; filter dropdown shows them separately
- **IPG campus URLs** — 27 IPG campuses populated with correct website URLs
- **Annual STPM data refresh procedure** — Documented in `docs/stpm-annual-refresh.md`

### Changed
- **Search limit** — Backend limit bumped from 100 to 10000 for full result sets
- **Merit colour logic** — STPM mata gred courses use inverted colours (low = green/good); arts stream ≤12 green, science ≤18 green
- **Pre-U course detail** — Department and WBL fields hidden for pre-U courses (not meaningful)
- **"More Info" pill style** — STPM detail page changed from "View on ePanduan (MOHE)" text link to compact pill button

### Fixed
- **1 dead MOHE URL** — UJ6521004 cleared after Selenium validation confirmed "daripada 0 carian"
- **Kolej Komuniti URL** — 1 missing institution URL fixed
- **Search pathway_type** — Search results now include `pathway_type` and `qualification` fields for correct badge rendering

- **401 for unauthenticated** — Added `SupabaseAuthentication` DRF class; unauthenticated requests now return 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` instead of 403 (TD-011)
- **DRF status constants** — All raw integer status codes replaced with DRF constants (TD-004)
- **EligibilityCheckView refactored** — Extracted 5 pure functions into `eligibility_service.py`, view reduced from 310 → 100 lines (TD-045)
- **Double DataFrame iteration eliminated** — `_apply_pismp_dedup()` no longer iterates twice (TD-044)

### Fixed
- **ProfileUpdateSerializer** — PUT/PATCH profile now validates via serializer instead of accepting arbitrary fields (TD-008)

### Fixed
- **TD-001: STPM SPM prerequisite check** — Added `spm_pass_bi` and `spm_pass_math` to `SIMPLE_CHECKS` in `stpm_engine.py`. Zero programmes currently set these flags, so no eligibility results changed. STPM golden master baseline unchanged at 1,811.
- **TD-050: Quiz language bug** — Quiz page now reads locale from i18n context (`useT()`) instead of non-existent `halatuju_lang` localStorage key. Quiz loads in the user's selected language (EN/BM/TA).
- **TD-007: Bare except in engine.py** — `check_merit_probability()` now catches `(ValueError, TypeError)` instead of bare `except:`.
- **TD-020: Duplicate serializer key** — Removed duplicate `credit_stv` entry in `SPECIAL_FIELDS` dict.
- **TD-018: Duplicate import** — Removed redundant `from django.db.models import Count, Subquery, OuterRef` inside `EligibilityCheckView.post()`.

STPM Subjects and SPM Prerequisites moved from left column to sidebar.

### Changed
- **Search: ILJTM/ILKBS resolution** — Search API now resolves `tvet` → `iljtm`/`ilkbs` using `course_pathway_map`; filter options show ILJTM and ILKBS separately instead of hidden `tvet`
- **Search: course limit removed** — Backend no longer caps at 100 courses; explore page shows all results
- **Course detail: merit label** — "Avg. Mata Gred" → "Max Grade Points" (i18n) for `stpm_mata_gred` merit type
- **Course detail: merit colour logic** — Arts stream: ≤12 green, 13-18 amber, >18 red; Science stream: ≤18 green, >18 amber

### Fixed
- **ILJTM/ILKBS badges on explore page** — CourseCard now receives `pathway_type` from search API, showing correct ILJTM/ILKBS badges instead of undefined

- **PATCH endpoint** — `PATCH /api/v1/saved-courses/<course_id>/` for updating interest status
- **Nav bar integration** — "My Profile" link added to top nav, dropdown menu, and mobile menu (all point to `/profile`)
- **i18n** — profile page translated in EN, BM, and TA (16 keys per language)
- **Exam-type page redesign** — gradient icon boxes, decorative corners, left-aligned layout, hover effects
- **Course detail page review** — documented 10 issues and prioritised fixes in `docs/Course Detail Page.pdf`

### Changed
- Profile API (`GET/PUT /api/v1/profile/`) returns and accepts new fields
- Profile sync (`POST /api/v1/profile/sync/`) accepts new fields
- Saved courses API (`GET /api/v1/saved-courses/`) returns `interest_status` per course
- "My Profile" links in header dropdown and mobile menu now point to `/profile` (was `/onboarding/grades`)

### Technical Notes
- 13 new backend tests (6 model + 3 SavedCourse + 4 API). Total: 188 collected, 179 pass (9 pre-existing JWT failures). Golden master: 8280
- Frontend build passes clean. `/profile` route: 4.3 kB (169 kB first load)
- Deployed as backend rev 40, frontend rev 44
- Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-03-09-my-profile-design.md`
- Stitch mockup: `projects/13238979537238863747`

## [1.25.1] - 2026-03-09 — Merit Score Fix

### Fixed
- **Merit score mismatch** — grades page showed 68.88 but course cards showed 56.38 for the same student. The backend was recalculating merit using a different subject grouping (5/3/1) instead of the correct UPU formula (4/2/2). Now the frontend sends its pre-computed merit score to the backend, eliminating the duplicate calculation entirely.

### Changed
- **Eligibility endpoint** — accepts optional `student_merit` field. When provided, skips backend recalculation. Falls back to old calculation for backwards compatibility.

### Technical Notes
- Frontend: grades page saves `finalMerit` to localStorage; dashboard includes it in API payload
- Backend: serializer accepts `student_merit`; view uses it directly when present
- 166 tests pass (9 pre-existing JWT failures unchanged). Golden master: 8280
- Deployed as backend rev 33, frontend rev 42

## [1.25.0] - 2026-02-26 — Eligible Toggle Auth Gate + Merit Progress Bar

### Added
- **Eligible toggle prompts login** — clicking the "Eligible Only" toggle on `/search` now opens the auth gate modal if the user is not logged in, encouraging account creation. Previously the toggle was permanently disabled because `halatuju_eligible_courses` was never written to localStorage.
- **`eligible` auth gate reason** — new `AuthGateReason` type, i18n strings (EN, BM, TA), resume action so toggle auto-activates after login
- **Merit progress bar indicator (Variation C)** — replaced simple traffic-light dot with a visual progress bar showing the student's score inside the bar, a dashed cutoff line, and "High/Fair/Low Chance" label with numeric scores (e.g. "You: 72 | Need: 65")
- **`eligibleMap` state** on search page — stores full `EligibleCourse` data (not just IDs), enabling merit scores to flow into CourseCard on the search page

### Changed
- **Eligible toggle** — changed from disabled `<label>` to always-clickable `<button>` element
- **MeritIndicator component** — now accepts `studentMerit` and `meritCutoff` props; falls back to simple dot+label when numeric scores are unavailable

### Technical Notes
- Frontend only — no backend changes, no migrations
- Build passes cleanly
- Deployed as frontend rev 40 (eligible toggle) and rev 41 (merit progress bar)
- Backend rev remains 32

## [1.23.4] - 2026-02-26 — Stitch Design Polish

### Changed
- **Pill labels shortened** — "All Institution Types" → "Institution Type", "All Levels" → "Course Level", etc. (EN, BM, TA)
- **Pill background** — white → gray-100 fill matching Stitch design
- **Search placeholder** — descriptive: "Search for courses, institutions, or fields (e.g. Computer Science, UM)..."
- **Clear Filters always visible** — greyed out when no filters active, blue when filters applied

## [1.23.3] - 2026-02-26 — Filter Pill Dropdown Redesign

### Changed
- **Filter dropdowns restyled as pill/chip buttons** — replaced 4 native HTML `<select>` elements with custom `FilterPill` component matching Stitch design (compact rounded pills, chevron icon, dropdown panels)
- **Active filter state** — selected pills highlight with primary blue border/background
- **Clear Filters button** — now has funnel icon and rounded-full styling to match pills
- **Outside-click dismiss** — dropdown panels close when clicking outside

### Technical Notes
- New component: `src/components/FilterPill.tsx` (~100 lines, uses `clsx`)
- No new dependencies, no backend changes, no i18n changes
- Build passes cleanly

## [1.23.2] - 2026-02-25 — Search Page Stitch Alignment

### Added
- **Institution info on search cards** — each course card now shows the primary institution name, state (pin icon), and "+N more" count when offered at multiple institutions
- **Book icon** on field text in course cards for visual consistency with Stitch design
- **Clear Filters button** — appears in the filter row when any filter is active, resets all filters in one click
- **Eligibility toggle redesign** — replaced plain checkbox with a styled pill toggle, moved into the filter row with descriptive subtitle text
- **Search API: institution fields** — backend now returns `institution_name` and `institution_state` per course via Django Subquery (alphabetically first offering)
- **3 new backend tests** for institution name, state, and empty-offering fallback
- **3 new i18n keys** (`clearFilters`, `eligibleToggleDesc`, `moreInstitutions`) in EN, BM, TA

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 173 collected, 164 passing (9 pre-existing JWT failures — not production)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Files changed: 8 (1 backend view, 1 test, 1 API type, 3 i18n, 1 component, 1 page)

## [1.23.1] - 2026-02-25 — Deploy Fix: Suspense Boundary

### Fixed
- **Next.js prerender crash** — `/search` page crashed during Cloud Run build because `useSearchParams()` requires a `<Suspense>` boundary for static generation. Wrapped `SearchPageInner` in `<Suspense>` with a loading spinner fallback.
- **Stale container image** — previous failed deploy pushed a stale image to gcr.io (old Container Registry). Redeployed from source to Artifact Registry (`asia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev`), restoring correct build. Frontend now on rev 35.

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 173 passing (13 pre-existing JWT test failures — not a production issue)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)

## [1.23.0] - 2026-02-25 — Course Search / Explorer

### Added
- **Course search page** (`/search`) — browse the full course catalogue with text search and 4 filters (Institution Type, Course Level, State, Field)
- **Search API** (`GET /api/v1/courses/search/`) — server-side filtering, pagination, dynamic filter options, institution count per course
- **Eligible-only toggle** — if student has eligibility data, toggle to show only courses they qualify for
- **"Explore" nav link** — added to header between Dashboard and Saved
- **i18n** — full search page translations in EN, BM, TA
- **10 backend tests** for the search endpoint (text, level, field, source_type, state, pagination, combined, institution count)

### Changed
- **Institution URLs** — corrected 7 broken/outdated institution website links in `data/institutions.csv`

## [1.22.4] - 2026-02-25 — Profile Page Polish

### Changed
- **Profile icons** — replaced emoji icons (🇲🇾, 🌍, 👨, 👩, 🎨, ♿) with inline SVG icons for nationality, gender, and health condition buttons; icons change colour when selected
- **"Non-Malaysian" label** — renamed to "Foreign" (EN), "Asing" (BM), "வெளிநாட்டவர்" (TA) for clarity

## [1.22.3] - 2026-02-23 — Merit Formula Fix + Supabase Security

### Fixed
- **UPU merit formula** — replaced incorrect engine.py port with correct UPU calculation: `weighted = (core/72×40) + (stream/36×30) + (elective/36×10)`, `academic = weighted × 9/8`, cap 90 + CoQ
- **Stale grades bug** — grades from previously-selected subjects lingered in localStorage, inflating merit score; now only grades for currently-selected subjects (core + aliran + electives) are loaded
- **Dynamic merit on subject switch** — clearing old subject grades when switching stream, aliran, or elective subjects so merit updates immediately
- **14 Supabase RLS initplan warnings** — rewrote all RLS policies using `(select auth.uid())` subselect for performance
- **Supabase `django_migrations` RLS** — enabled Row Level Security on Django migrations table (security advisory)

### Changed
- **Merit score display** — removed green/yellow colour coding; score displays in neutral grey (no judgement)
- **Merit calculation** — grades page now passes categorised grades (core/stream/elective) directly instead of flat map with heuristic splitting

## [1.22.2] - 2026-02-23 — UI Polish: Grades Page

### Changed
- **Subject renames** — "Bahasa Tamil" → "Bahasa Cina/Tamil", "Bahasa Cina" → "Kesusasteraan Cina/Tamil" (combined options to shorten dropdown)
- **Stream pills** — equal-width grid layout, less rounded (rounded-xl), two-tone SVG icons (flask/book/wrench)
- **Shadow/depth treatment** — subtle shadows on core subject cards, stream pills, compact subject rows, merit panel, grade buttons (modern soft style)

### Added
- **Lukisan** — new subject in Arts stream pool and elective list (distinct from PSV)
- **StreamIcon component** — two-tone SVG icons for science/arts/technical streams

## [1.22.1] - 2026-02-23 — Sprint 20: Merit Score & CoQ

### Added
- **Co-curricular (CoQ) score input** — decimal number input (0-10, e.g. 5.50, 7.85) on profile page
- **Live merit score panel** — grades page shows real-time academic merit (/ 90) + CoQ (/ 10) = total (/ 100) as grades are entered
- **Client-side merit calculator** — TypeScript port of `engine.py` formula in `lib/merit.ts` (`prepareMeritInputs` + `calculateMeritScore`)
- New translation keys in EN, BM, TA: coqScore, coqHint, meritScore, academicMerit, coqMerit, meritTotal

### Fixed
- **Stream subject pre-population** — first-time visitors now see default stream subjects (PHY/CHE for science) instead of empty dropdowns

### Changed
- **Backend CoQ passthrough** — `EligibilityRequestSerializer` now accepts `coq_score` (float, 0-10); `views.py` uses it instead of hardcoded 5.0
- Dashboard passes saved CoQ from profile localStorage to eligibility API
- `StudentProfile` interface updated with optional `coq_score` field

## [1.22.0] - 2026-02-23 — Sprint 20: Onboarding Redesign

### Added
- **SPM/STPM exam type selection** — new `/onboarding/exam-type` screen with SPM card (active) and STPM card (coming soon)
- **Progress stepper** — shared `ProgressStepper` component shows "Step 1 of 3" with visual progress bars across all onboarding screens
- **Negeri (state) dropdown** — 16 Malaysian states/territories added to profile page
- **Elective subject add button** — "Tambah Subjek Elektif" dashed button to dynamically add 0-2 elective subjects
- New translation keys in EN, BM, TA for all new UI elements

### Changed
- **Stream + grades merged** — stream selection (compact pill buttons) now lives on the grades page, removing one navigation step
- **Core subjects redesign** — button grid with green checkmark on completion, clear icon, responsive 5+5 mobile layout
- **Stream/elective subjects redesign** — compact dropdown + grade badge dropdown rows replacing full button grids
- **Profile page compact layout** — single card with Negeri, Jantina toggle, Nationality toggle, Keperluan Khas checkboxes with accessibility icons
- **Improved helper text** — contextual subtitles on each screen ("Enter your grades so we can find courses that match your results")
- All `/onboarding/stream` links updated to `/onboarding/exam-type` across landing, dashboard, footer, login pages

### Removed
- `/onboarding/stream` page — stream selection moved into grades page

### Technical Notes
- Next.js build: 20 routes, 0 errors
- Files: 10 modified/created, 1 deleted
- Backend tests: 176 (unchanged — frontend-only sprint)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)

## [1.21.0] - 2026-02-23 — Course Image Classification (37 Categories)

### Added
- **37 AI-generated course images** — replaced 9 generic field images with 37 category-specific images generated via Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, covering all 383 courses
- **Keyword-based image matching** — `CourseCard.tsx` now uses a multi-level matcher (`getImageSlug`) that routes courses to images based on field name and course name keywords
- **Sub-routing for large fields** — Pendidikan (73 courses) splits into 5 teaching-subject images; Mekanikal & Pembuatan (24) into 4; Elektrik & Elektronik (13) into 3; Teknologi Maklumat into 2
- **"Umum" dissolution** — 17 miscategorised "Umum" courses now route to proper categories via course name matching (e.g. perikanan → pertanian, bank → perakaunan)
- **Future STPM images** — pre-created images for Undang-undang and Farmasi categories

### Changed
- **Every course now has an image** — previous system had 97% of courses showing a grey placeholder (only 13/383 matched). Now 383/383 resolve to a relevant image
- **`getFieldImageUrl` signature** — now takes `(field, courseName)` instead of just `(field)`, enabling course-name-based sub-routing
- **Image generation script** — `tools/generate_field_images.py` rewritten with 37 categories, detailed Malaysian-context prompts, and `--skip-existing` flag

### Technical Notes
- 37 images uploaded to Supabase Storage `field-images` bucket (~1.5-2 MB each)
- 15-max rule: no image category covers more than 15 courses
- Next.js build: 20 routes compiled successfully
- Modified files: `CourseCard.tsx`, `generate_field_images.py`, `CHANGELOG.md`

## [1.20.0] - 2026-02-23 — Sprint 18: Header & Footer Redesign

### Added
- **AppHeader component** — shared responsive header with logo (120px), Dashboard/Saved nav links with active indicator, profile dropdown (name, email, My Profile, My Applications, Settings, Log Out), mobile hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
- **AppFooter component** — shared footer with brand column + tagline, Quick Links (Dashboard, Start Here, Saved), Legal links (About, Privacy, Terms, Cookies), copyright bar with Contact Us link
- **Profile dropdown** — shows user initials avatar, full name and email from Supabase session metadata, grouped account actions, red Log Out button with sign-out via Supabase
- **Cookies page** (`/cookies`) — explains essential cookies only, no tracking/analytics, links to Settings for data clearing
- **Contact page** (`/contact`) — Tamil Foundation (MCEF) contact info, email for enquiries and data deletion requests
- **Logout functionality** — first time users can sign out (calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`, redirects to landing)
- **i18n keys** — `header.*` (myProfile, myApplications, logout), `footer.*` (tagline, quickLinks, legal, startHere), `common.cookies`, `common.contact` in all 3 languages (EN, BM, TA)

### Changed
- **Logo optimised** — compressed from 6.2 MB to 27 KB (99.6% reduction), transparent background, 480px wide for retina
- **Logo size increased** — rendered at 120×40px across all pages (was 60×32px), improves brand visibility
- **All pages now use shared header/footer** — dashboard, saved, settings, outcomes, about, privacy, terms, course detail, report. Landing page uses shared footer with its own hero header. Quiz page keeps focused workflow header.
- **About/Privacy/Terms pages** — upgraded from back-arrow mini-headers to full AppHeader + AppFooter
- **Privacy page** — added contact email link

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 176 (unchanged) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Next.js build: 20 routes compiled successfully
- New files: `AppHeader.tsx`, `AppFooter.tsx`, `/cookies/page.tsx`, `/contact/page.tsx`
- Modified: 15 frontend files, 0 backend files

## [1.19.1] - 2026-02-22 — Post-Sprint 17 Hotfixes

### Fixed
- **ES256 JWT authentication**: Supabase user access tokens use ES256 (JWKS), but middleware only accepted HS256 — all authenticated API calls (saved-courses, reports, outcomes) returned 403. Middleware now checks token `alg` header and routes to HS256 (JWT secret) or ES256 (JWKS public key via `PyJWKClient`).
- **Missing Cloud Run env vars**: Added `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_URL` to backend Cloud Run service.
- **Google name pre-fill**: AuthGateModal now pre-fills the user's name from their Google profile on OAuth sign-in.

### Added
- **"Read Report" button**: Dashboard shows "Read Report" (linking to existing report) instead of "Generate Report" when a report already exists. Reverts to "Generate Report" on quiz retake.
- **3 i18n keys**: `dashboard.readReport` in EN ("Read Report"), BM ("Baca Laporan"), TA ("அறிக்கையைப் படி")

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 176 (unchanged) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Deployed: backend rev 26, frontend rev 20
- Cloud Run env vars added: `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`
- JWKS client uses `PyJWKClient` from `PyJWT` with automatic key caching

## [1.19.0] - 2026-02-22 — Sprint 17: Outcome Tracking

### Added
- **AdmissionOutcome model** — tracks student application outcomes (applied/offered/accepted/rejected/withdrawn) per course+institution, with intake year, session, notes, and date fields
- **CRUD endpoints** (`/api/v1/outcomes/` and `/api/v1/outcomes/<id>/`) — list, create, update status, delete. All auth-required, filtered to own outcomes.
- **"I Applied!" / "I Got an Offer!" buttons** on saved courses page — inline outcome creation with optimistic UI
- **Outcomes page** (`/outcomes`) — "My Applications" page listing all outcomes with colour-coded status badges, inline status editing, and delete
- **Track Applications CTA** on saved courses page — links to outcomes page
- **20 i18n keys** in `outcomes.*` section across all 3 locales (EN, BM, Tamil)
- 10 new backend tests: CRUD, duplicate (409), auth enforcement (403), cross-user isolation

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 176 (+10) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Frontend build: passes clean
- Migration 0009 applied: `admission_outcomes` table with RLS + 5 policies
- Supabase security advisor: 0 errors (excluding known `django_migrations`)
- Sprint 16 deployed: backend rev 21, frontend rev 17

## [1.18.0] - 2026-02-22 — Sprint 16: Registration Gate

### Added
- **AuthGateModal** (`components/AuthGateModal.tsx`): Multi-step registration modal with inline Phone OTP + Google OAuth sign-in, reason-specific messaging (quiz/save/report), benefit bullets, and name+school profile completion form
- **AuthContext** (`lib/auth-context.tsx`): `AuthProvider` + `useAuth()` hook wrapping Supabase session state, providing `token`, `isAuthenticated`, `showAuthGate(reason)`, `hideAuthGate()`. Detects pending Google OAuth actions on mount.
- **ProfileSyncView** (`POST /api/v1/profile/sync/`): New backend endpoint that bulk-pushes localStorage data (grades, gender, quiz signals, name, school) to backend after first login — creates or updates profile in one call
- **`name` + `school` fields** on `StudentProfile` model (migration 0008) — for follow-up tracking
- **Profile sync API** (`syncProfile()` in `api.ts`) + `SyncProfileData` type
- **21 i18n keys** in `authGate.*` section across all 3 locales (EN, BM, Tamil)
- 4 new backend tests: sync creates profile, sync updates existing, sync rejects anon, profile PUT accepts name/school

### Changed
- **Dashboard**: Save button always visible (gates on auth if not logged in), Report CTA always visible (was hidden for guests), Quiz CTA triggers auth gate instead of direct navigation. Actions auto-resume after auth completion via localStorage resume action.
- **Quiz page**: Gated behind authentication — shows sign-in prompt with auth gate trigger for unauthenticated visitors
- **Dashboard imports**: Replaced ad-hoc `getSession()` with `useAuth()` hook for consistent auth state

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 166 (+4) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Frontend build: passes clean
- Google OAuth edge case handled: pending action stored in localStorage before redirect, AuthProvider restores it on mount, modal opens at profile step
- New files: `components/AuthGateModal.tsx`, `lib/auth-context.tsx`
- Modified: `providers.tsx`, `dashboard/page.tsx`, `quiz/page.tsx`, `api.ts`, `views.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py`, `en.json`, `ms.json`, `ta.json`

## [1.17.0] - 2026-02-22 — Sprint 16: Bilingual Descriptions Pipeline

### Added
- `headline_en` and `description_en` fields on Course model (migration 0007)
- `load_course_descriptions()` method in data loader — reads `course_descriptions.json`, populates all 4 description fields
- `data/course_descriptions.json` — 383 bilingual course descriptions extracted from `src/description.py`
- Course detail page now shows locale-appropriate headline and description (BM for `ms`, EN for `en`/`ta`)
- `courseDetail.*` i18n keys added to all 3 locale files (EN, BM, Tamil)
- 6 new tests: bilingual API fields, empty defaults, description loading, TVET overwrite protection

### Fixed
- TVET metadata loader no longer overwrites rich descriptions with thin CSV text (conditional update)

### Technical Notes
- CourseSerializer now exposes `headline_en`, `description_en`
- Frontend `Course` interface updated with new fields
- Supabase migration applied: `ALTER TABLE courses ADD COLUMN headline_en/description_en`
- Backend tests: 162 (was 156) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)

## [1.16.1] - 2026-02-21 — Description Sprint: Quality Audit + English Translations

### Added
- English translations (`headline_en`, `synopsis_en`) for all 383 course descriptions in `src/description.py` — enables bilingual course cards
- `headline` field added to all entries (previously only `synopsis` existed)
- English fallback defaults in `get_course_details()` function

### Fixed
- 33 description quality issues across all 6 institution types:
  - 25 "mereka" (third-person) pronoun fixes → "anda" (second-person, direct address)
  - 2 typos: "DANN" → "DAN", "turu padang" → "turun padang"
  - 2 thin descriptions expanded (IJTM-CET-035, IJTM-CET-037)
  - 3 headline fixes ("Suara Untuk Mereka" → "Suara Untuk Semua")
  - 1 "kita" → "anda" fix

### Technical Notes
- `src/description.py`: ~2,400 → ~3,090 lines
- All 383 entries verified via AST parsing — 100% bilingual coverage
- British English spelling throughout translations
- Backend tests: 156 (unchanged) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)

## [1.16.0] - 2026-02-20 — Sprint 15: Career Pathways (MASCO Integration)

### Added
- **MascoOccupation model**: New Django model with `masco_code` (PK), `job_title`, `emasco_url` — stores 272 MASCO-classified occupations from Malaysia's official eMASCO portal
- **Course ↔ Occupation M2M**: `Course.career_occupations` ManyToManyField links courses to career outcomes (531 unique links across all TVET and Polytechnic courses)
- **Career Pathways on course detail**: New "Career Pathways" section on `/course/[id]` page shows clickable indigo pill badges linking to eMASCO portal pages for each linked occupation
- **API: career_occupations in course detail**: `GET /api/v1/courses/<id>/` now returns `career_occupations` list with `masco_code`, `job_title`, and `emasco_url`
- **MASCO data loaders**: Two new methods in `load_csv_data.py` — `load_masco_occupations` (from `masco_details.csv`) and `load_course_masco_links` (from `course_masco_link.csv` with deduplication)
- **8 new tests**: 3 API tests (career occupations in detail, field validation, empty list) + 5 model tests (PK, M2M, reverse relation, idempotent update_or_create, __str__)
- Migration `0005_add_masco_occupations`

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 156 (+8) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Data loaded into Supabase with RLS enabled (public read) on both `masco_occupations` and `courses_course_career_occupations` tables
- MASCO data sourced from existing project files (`data/masco_details.csv`, `data/course_masco_link.csv`) — originally used by legacy Streamlit app
- eMASCO portal pages contain starting salary, annual increment, demand status, and job descriptions

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-20 — Sprint 14: TVET Data Fix + UX Polish

### Fixed
- **TVET orphaned courses**: All 84 TVET courses had zero institution links because `load_course_details` used `.filter().update()` on non-existent `CourseInstitution` records. Changed to `update_or_create` so TVET rows in `details.csv` create links when none exist.
- **Institution taxonomy**: 55 ILKBS/ILJTM institutions were incorrectly typed as `IPTA`. Changed to `ILKA` in `data/institutions.csv` and Supabase DB (157 IPTA + 55 ILKA).

### Added
- **181 TVET course-institution links** now loaded correctly — IKBN/IKTBN/IKSN courses linked to ILKBS institutions, ILP/ADTEC/JMTI courses linked to ILJTM institutions, with fees, allowances, and application hyperlinks.
- **Settings page redesign** (`settings/page.tsx`): Language selector, clear profile data button, about section — fully localised (EN/BM/TA).
- **Saved page i18n**: Localised with `useT()` hook across all 3 locales.
- **Settings and saved i18n keys**: Added `settings.*` and `saved.*` translation keys to all 3 locale files.

### Changed
- **Gemini SDK migration**: `google-generativeai` (deprecated) replaced with `google-genai` v1.x Client API pattern in `report_engine.py`. Updated mocks in `test_report_engine.py`.
- **`requirements.txt`**: `google-generativeai>=0.3,<1.0` → `google-genai>=1.0,<2.0`

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 148 (unchanged) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Both `halatuju-api` and `halatuju-web` deployed to Cloud Run
- Data fix applied directly to Supabase DB (55 institution type updates + 181 link inserts)

## [1.14.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 13: Localisation (EN/BM/TA)

### Added
- **i18n infrastructure** (`lib/i18n.tsx`): React context with `useT()` hook, localStorage-persisted locale preference, static JSON imports for zero-latency switching
- **Language selector** (`components/LanguageSelector.tsx`): Dropdown in landing page nav and dashboard header — switches between English, Bahasa Melayu, and Tamil
- **142 translation keys** per locale across 6 sections: common, landing, onboarding, dashboard, login, subjects
- **i18n validation script** (`scripts/check-i18n.js`): Checks JSON parsing, key completeness across all 3 locales, and no empty values

### Changed
- **6 core pages localised**: Landing, stream selection, grades input, profile input, dashboard, and login — all hardcoded strings replaced with `t('key')` calls
- **Landing page** converted from server component to client component to support `useT()` hook
- **Grades page**: Core subject labels now use translated `t('subjects.XX')` keys; stream/elective subjects retain official Malay names
- **Dashboard sub-components** (`InsightsPanel`, `FilterDropdown`, `RankedResults`, `LoadingScreen`) each call `useT()` for their own translated strings
- **Tamil translations** quality-reviewed per style guide: brand name kept as "HalaTuju", compound words joined, sandhi rules applied

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 148 (unchanged) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- Frontend-only sprint — no backend changes, no migrations
- New files: `lib/i18n.tsx`, `components/LanguageSelector.tsx`, `scripts/check-i18n.js`
- Modified: 3 JSON translation files + 6 page files + `providers.tsx`

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 12: Report Frontend + PDF

### Added
- **Report display page** (`/report/[id]`): Renders AI counsellor report as formatted markdown with `react-markdown` and Tailwind Typography prose styling
- **PDF download**: "Download PDF" button using `window.print()` with `@media print` stylesheet (A4, clean layout, hidden nav)
- **Generate Report CTA** on dashboard: Auth-protected button calls `POST /api/v1/reports/generate/`, redirects to report page on success
- **Report API client functions** in `api.ts`: `generateReport()`, `getReport()`, `getReports()` with TypeScript types
- 4 new view tests: report list (own reports only), report detail, cross-user 404 regression, validation

### Fixed
- **FK bug in report views**: `ReportDetailView` and `ReportListView` filtered by `student_id=request.user_id` (comparing integer PK with UUID string — would never match). Fixed to `student__supabase_user_id=request.user_id`

### Dependencies
- Added `react-markdown@10.1.0` for markdown rendering
- Added `@tailwindcss/typography` for prose styling

## [1.12.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 11: AI Report Backend

### Added
- **Report engine** (`apps/reports/report_engine.py`): Gemini-powered narrative counselor report generator with model cascade fallback (gemini-2.5-flash → gemini-2.5-flash-lite → gemini-2.0-flash)
- **Report prompts** (`apps/reports/prompts.py`): BM and EN counselor report templates ported from legacy Streamlit, with counselor personas (Cikgu Venu, Cikgu Gopal, Cikgu Guna)
- **Report API endpoints**: `POST /api/v1/reports/generate/` (generate report), `GET /api/v1/reports/` (list), `GET /api/v1/reports/<id>/` (detail) — all auth-protected
- 12 new tests: format helpers (grades, signals, courses, insights), prompt templates (BM/EN), persona mapping, Gemini mock (success, cascade fallback, missing API key)

### Changed
- Report views wired up (previously stubs returning "coming soon")
- Reports URL config updated with list endpoint

## [1.11.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 10: Deterministic Insights

### Added
- **Insights engine** (`insights_engine.py`): Pure function that generates structured summaries from eligibility results — stream breakdown, top fields, level distribution, merit summary, and Malay summary text
- **Insights in eligibility response**: `POST /api/v1/eligibility/check/` now returns an `insights` key alongside `eligible_courses` and `stats`
- **InsightsPanel component** on dashboard: Three-column layout showing top fields (Bidang Teratas), level distribution (Tahap Pengajian), and merit bar chart (Peluang Kemasukan)
- 8 new tests: empty input, stream breakdown, labels, top fields ranking, merit counts, level distribution, summary text
- **KKOM separation**: Kolej Komuniti requirements split into dedicated `kkom_requirements.csv` with `source_type: 'kkom'`

### Changed
- Eligibility API response now includes `insights` object for frontend consumption
- Dashboard displays insights panel between stats cards and quiz CTA
- API types updated with `Insights`, `InsightsStreamItem`, `InsightsFieldItem`, `InsightsLevelItem` interfaces

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 9: Data Gap Filling

### Added
- **TVET course metadata**: 84 TVET courses enriched with names, levels, departments, descriptions, semesters, and WBL flags from `tvet_courses.csv`
- **PISMP course metadata**: 73 PISMP courses enriched with level (Ijazah Sarjana Muda Pendidikan), department, field, semesters (8), and auto-generated Malay descriptions
- **Institution modifiers in DB**: Added `modifiers` JSONField to Institution model — ranking modifiers (urban, cultural_safety_net, etc.) now stored in PostgreSQL instead of loaded from filesystem JSON
- **`audit_data` management command**: Reports data completeness across courses, requirements, institutions, offerings, and tags
- 5 new tests: TVET enrichment, PISMP enrichment, institution modifiers storage

### Fixed
- **Institution modifiers not working on Cloud Run**: Modifiers were read from `data/institutions.json` at startup, but this file isn't in the Docker image. Now loaded from DB via `load_csv_data`.

### Technical Notes
- Migration 0004: adds `modifiers` JSONField (default={}) to Institution
- All 383 courses now have complete metadata (description, level, department, field, frontend_label, semesters)
- `load_csv_data` now runs 9 loaders in sequence: courses → requirements → tvet_metadata → pismp_metadata → institutions → modifiers → links → details → tags

## [1.9.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 8: Course Detail Enhancement

### Added
- **Course offering details** in `/course/[id]` API response — tuition fees, hostel fees, registration fee, monthly/practical allowances, free hostel/meals flags, application hyperlink
- **"Apply" button** on institution cards linking to official application portals (407 courses with hyperlinks)
- **Fee display** on institution cards — tuition, hostel, and registration fees in a clean grid layout
- **Benefit badges** — "Free Hostel", "Free Meals", and "RM{amount}/month" allowance badges on institution cards
- **`load_course_details`** management command method — loads `details.csv` to enrich CourseInstitution rows (TVET: per-institution, Poly/Univ: per-course)
- 5 new backend tests: offering fees, hyperlink, allowances, free badges, empty field handling

### Technical Notes
- No schema migration needed — CourseInstitution model already had fee fields from initial setup
- `details.csv` (407 rows): TVET rows have institution_id (per-institution fees), Poly/Univ rows don't (shared fees across all institutions)
- Golden master unchanged at 8280 (no engine changes)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-18 — Sprint 7: PISMP Integration

### Added
- **73 PISMP (teacher training) courses** integrated into eligibility engine — new `source_type: 'pismp'`
- **PISMP data file** (`data/pismp_requirements.csv`) — cleaned and formatted from draft
- **"Teacher Training" filter** in dashboard dropdown and stat card
- **Amber badge styling** for PISMP courses (`bg-amber-100 text-amber-700`)
- 8 new backend tests: eligibility, exclusion, borderline, subject-specific, Malaysian-only, stats, merit labels, subject requirements
- Django migration `0003_add_pismp_source_type`

### Fixed
- **Empty subjects bug** in `check_subject_group_logic`: rules with `subjects: []` (meaning "any N subjects at grade X") were silently skipped. Now counts from all student grades. Critical for PISMP's "5 Cemerlang from any subjects" requirement.
- **NaN guard** in `check_subject_group_logic` and `check_complex_requirements`: non-string input (NaN from DataFrame concat) no longer crashes the engine

### Technical Notes
- Golden master unchanged at 8280 (PISMP data is additive, no existing courses affected)
- PISMP courses have no `merit_cutoff` — merit labels are `null` (same as TVET)
- `age_limit` field in PISMP data not implemented (not in student profile) — documented as future enhancement

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-17 — Sprint 6: Dashboard Redesign (Card Grid)

### Added
- **Merit traffic lights** on course cards: Green (High Chance), amber (Fair Chance), red (Low Chance) indicators based on student merit vs course cutoff
- **Student merit calculation** in eligibility endpoint: Computes merit score from SPM grades using UPU-style formula, returns `merit_label`, `merit_color`, `student_merit` per course
- **CourseCard component** (`components/CourseCard.tsx`): Extracted reusable vertical card with field image header, merit indicator, rank badge, and fit reason tags
- 2 new backend tests for merit labels in eligibility response

### Changed
- **Dashboard layout**: Responsive card grid (3 col desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile) replaces single-column list
- **Card design**: Vertical layout with field image on top instead of horizontal flex
- Low merit courses (`merit_label === 'Low'`) rendered with reduced opacity
- TVET courses show no merit indicator (no cutoff data)
- Dashboard reduced from ~764 to ~370 lines by extracting CourseCard and FilterDropdown

### Fixed
- **Ranking merit penalty** now works correctly: `student_merit` included in eligibility response flows through to ranking API (previously defaulted to 0)
- Grade key mismatch: `prepare_merit_inputs` expects `'history'`, serializer produces `'hist'` — adapted in eligibility view

### Technical Notes
- Backend tests: 106 (+2) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- New files: `src/components/CourseCard.tsx` | Modified: `views.py`, `test_api.py`, `api.ts`, `dashboard/page.tsx`
- CoQ (co-curricular quality) score defaults to 5.0 — future enhancement to ask user

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-17 — Sprint 5: Quiz Frontend

### Added
- **Quiz page** (`/quiz`): Interactive 6-question quiz with step-by-step navigation, progress bar, and auto-advance on selection
- **Quiz API integration** (`lib/api.ts`): `getQuizQuestions()`, `submitQuiz()`, `getRankedResults()` functions with TypeScript types
- **Take Quiz CTA** on dashboard: Prominent gradient banner inviting users to personalise their rankings
- **Ranked results view** on dashboard: Top 5 matches with rank badges and fit reason tags, plus "Other Eligible Courses" section
- **Quiz state management**: Signals stored in localStorage; retake quiz option clears and resets
- **Quiz completed banner**: Green confirmation with retake link when quiz has been completed

### Changed
- Dashboard dynamically switches between flat eligibility list (no quiz) and ranked results (after quiz)
- Dashboard subtitle updates based on whether quiz has been taken

### Technical Notes
- Frontend-only sprint — no backend changes, no migrations
- Backend tests: 104 (unchanged) | Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- New files: `src/app/quiz/page.tsx` | Modified: `src/lib/api.ts`, `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Quiz signals persisted in `halatuju_quiz_signals` localStorage key
- Ranking query uses React Query with eligibility + signals as combined query key

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-17 — Sprint 4: Ranking Engine Backend

### Added
- **Ranking engine** (`apps/courses/ranking_engine.py`): Ported 551-line Streamlit ranking engine to Django — pure functions, no globals, no file I/O
- **Ranking endpoint** (`POST /api/v1/ranking/`): Accepts eligible courses + student signals, returns top 5 + rest with fit scores and natural language reasons
- **RankingRequestSerializer**: Validates eligible_courses (each must have course_id) and student_signals
- **Institution data loading**: AppConfig now loads course tags map, institution subcategories, and institution modifiers (from JSON) at startup
- **Ranking tests** (`test_ranking.py`): 34 new tests covering score calculation, category/institution/global cap enforcement, merit penalty (High/Fair/Low), sort tie-breaking (5 levels), credential priority, top_5/rest split, API endpoint validation

### Technical Notes
- Test count: 70 → 104 (+34 ranking tests)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- No migrations, no deploy (backend only)
- Ranking engine uses dependency injection — course tags and institution data passed as parameters, not loaded from files
- Institution modifiers (urban, cultural_safety_net) loaded from `data/institutions.json` at startup; future sprint will migrate to model fields

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-16 — Sprint 3: Quiz API Backend

### Added
- **Quiz data module** (`apps/courses/quiz_data.py`): 6 psychometric questions in 3 languages (EN, BM, TA), ported from `src/quiz_data.py`
- **Quiz engine** (`apps/courses/quiz_engine.py`): Stateless signal accumulator — takes answers in, returns categorised signals in 5-bucket taxonomy
- **Quiz questions endpoint** (`GET /api/v1/quiz/questions/?lang=en`): Returns quiz questions in requested language, public (no auth)
- **Quiz submit endpoint** (`POST /api/v1/quiz/submit/`): Accepts 6 answers, returns `student_signals` + `signal_strength`, public (no auth)
- **Quiz tests** (`test_quiz.py`): 14 new tests covering endpoint behaviour, signal accumulation, taxonomy mapping, validation, and language parity

### Technical Notes
- Test count: 56 → 70 (+14 quiz tests)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- No migrations, no deploy (backend only)
- `ProfileView.put()` already accepts `student_signals` — no change needed
- Quiz engine is fully stateless: no session, no DB writes. Frontend sends all 6 answers in one POST.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-16 — Sprint 2: Saved Courses Fix + Page Shells

### Added
- **Saved courses page** (`/saved`): Lists saved courses from API, remove button, login prompt for guests
- **Settings page** (`/settings`): Links to edit grades, saved courses, about, privacy, terms
- **About page** (`/about`): Project description and mission
- **Privacy policy page** (`/privacy`): Data collection, usage, and storage disclosure
- **Terms of service page** (`/terms`): Disclaimer and liability
- **Auth callback page** (`/auth/callback`): Handles OAuth redirect from Supabase, redirects to dashboard
- **Saved course CRUD tests**: 3 new tests covering save (201), list (appears), and delete (removed) (`test_saved_courses.py`)
- **Bookmark button on dashboard**: Logged-in users see a save/unsave bookmark icon on each course card with optimistic updates

### Fixed
- **`unsaveCourse` API call**: Changed from body-based DELETE (`/api/v1/saved-courses/` + body) to URL-based DELETE (`/api/v1/saved-courses/<course_id>/`) matching the backend route
- **`getSavedCourses` return type**: Updated from `string[]` to `Course[]` to match actual backend response

### Changed
- **Dashboard CourseCard**: Refactored from single `<Link>` wrapper to `<div>` with separate link area and save button, so save/click targets are independent
- **Dashboard saved state**: Now fetches from Supabase API when session exists (was not wired at all)

### Technical Notes
- Test count: 53 → 56 (+3 saved course CRUD tests)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- Frontend deployed: revision `halatuju-web-00007-wd8`

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-16 — Sprint 1: Git Housekeeping + Auth Enforcement

### Added
- **Sprint roadmap**: 15-sprint migration plan across 4 phases (`docs/roadmap/sprint-roadmap-v1.x.md`)
- **DRF permission class**: `SupabaseIsAuthenticated` for class-based views (`halatuju/middleware/supabase_auth.py`)
- **Auth enforcement**: `SavedCoursesView`, `SavedCourseDetailView`, `ProfileView` now require valid Supabase JWT
- **Auth tests**: 11 new tests covering protected endpoint rejection (403), authenticated access (200), and public endpoint openness (`test_auth.py`)
- **Git tracking**: All project code (`halatuju_api/`, `halatuju-web/`, `tools/`) now under version control
- **`.gitignore`**: Covers Node.js (`node_modules/`, `.next/`), Django (`*.sqlite3`, `staticfiles/`), and temp files (`.tmp/`)

### Changed
- **Protected views**: Replaced manual `if not request.user_id` checks with `permission_classes = [SupabaseIsAuthenticated]`
- **Migration 0002**: Renames `student_profiles` table to `api_student_profiles` (matching model's `db_table`), adds missing fields (`credit_math_or_addmath`, `credit_sci`, `credit_science_group`, `pass_sci`)

### Fixed
- **Table mismatch**: `StudentProfile.Meta.db_table = 'api_student_profiles'` didn't match migration 0001's `student_profiles` — generated migration 0002 to correct this

### Technical Notes
- DRF returns 403 (not 401) for unauthenticated requests when no `WWW-Authenticate` header is configured — this is expected behaviour
- Test count: 42 → 53 (+11 auth tests)
- Golden master: 8280 (unchanged)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-04
