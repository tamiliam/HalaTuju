/**
 * The list of screens the sandbox offers, and how each one is mounted.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY ENTRY MOUNTS A REAL COMPONENT. If a surface cannot be mounted without re-implementing
 * part of it, it does not belong here — fix the component so it can be mounted (usually by taking
 * its data as props), or leave the surface out. A hand-written approximation would be worse than
 * nothing: a designer would sign off on a screen that does not exist.
 *
 * `token` is a synthetic string, never a real session. It exists because the components take one;
 * the stubbed fetch ignores it, and there is no backend for it to reach.
