# HalaTuju Technical Debt Audit

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Auditor:** Claude (comprehensive codebase read)
**Scope:** halatuju_api + halatuju-web (full codebase)

---

## Executive Summary

**Original audit (2026-03-14): 52 issues** (High: 8, Medium: 22, Low: 22). ~42 resolved; ~10 low/medium
hygiene items still open (see the index below). The register has since grown a running log to **TD-151**.

> **Status is per-entry, not a master count.** Each entry carries its own `✅ RESOLVED` heading or
> `**Status:**` line — those are authoritative (a single hand-maintained tally rots, as the old "49/52"
> did). The **Open Items Index** immediately below is the curated at-a-glance list of what's still pending;
> regenerate it at each consolidation review rather than trusting any fixed number.

**Top 3 highest-risk items:**
1. **[TD-001] STPM SPM prerequisite fields not checked** — `spm_pass_bi` and `spm_pass_math` exist in the model but are silently ignored by the eligibility engine. Students may qualify for programmes they shouldn't.
2. **[TD-002] Client-side eligibility logic duplicated** — pathways.ts, merit.ts, and stpm.ts mirror backend logic using different subject key conventions. Any formula change must be made in two places with no automated cross-check.
3. **[TD-003] Zero frontend tests** — No test files in halatuju-web. LOW risk after TD-002 Sprint removed all frontend business logic.

**Category with most inconsistency:** Frontend-backend implicit contracts (11 items)

**Estimated fix sprints:** 6-8 sprints if addressed systematically (grouped by risk, not by category)

---

## Open Items Index (curated, as of 2026-06-29)

A single at-a-glance view of the **significant** pending TDs. The full detail lives in each entry below;
the per-entry marker is authoritative. The register uses two formats by era — `### [TD-NNN]` headings for the
2026-03 audit (TD-001–052) and the recent series (TD-144+), and a running **bullet log** (`- TD-NNN:`) for the
post-audit work (TD-053–143). Both are searchable by id.

**Go-live gates — legal / money (owner + lawyer + payment-gateway action, not just code):**
- **TD-075** — real payment + disbursement rails (toyyibPay, funding tranches, lapse cron, award/decline
  emails). The whole sponsorship money-flow is built **dark on mocked money** until these land.
- **TD-140** — Conditional Bursary Agreement: two Phase-0 gates — (1) lawyer vets the EN/BM clause template,
  (2) the Foundation entity + signatory are finalised (interim "Suresh") — before `BURSARY_AGREEMENT_ENABLED=1`.
- **TD-141** — bursary parent/guarantor signs **in-session only**; no separate parent-phone signing link (Phase 2).
- **TD-142** — the signed agreement *names* a payment schedule (RM500 + 10×RM250) it cannot yet honour;
  disbursement + suspension are mocked (Phase 3, folds into TD-075).
- **TD-148** — no officer/admin view of a student's bank details (the payout surface); folds into TD-075.

**Bursary / scholarship — operational:**
- **TD-144** — bursary-agreement panel ticks should derive from the real agreement once the feature is live.
- **TD-145** — a wrong **public**-university offer isn't caught when the declared institution field is blank.
- **TD-149** — no student path to change a bank account after they've confirmed it.
- **TD-150** — course matcher binds the wrong public `course_id` (poly-IT synthetic "majors"; private
  programmes force-matched); #95 sits on a placeholder pending his real specialisation.
- **TD-151** — document-extraction & income-computation robustness (the recurring mis-read class promoted from
  the 2026-06-29 consolidation review; a 1-sprint hardening pass).
- **TD-154** — document-slot uniqueness is **sweep-enforced only** (create-first then sweep the stale row per
  `(application, doc_type, household_member, request_code)`; TD-115), not a DB constraint. Optional hardening
  (deferred from the income-model plan, 2026-07-02): add a DB `UniqueConstraint` on the slot key + an
  orphan-`request_code`-doc cleanup. Behaviour is currently sound (no bug) — *low* risk.

**Admin roles / permissions:**
- **TD-152** — bursary is a named-personal-donor contract (Suresh, personally) until the org incorporates; novate to
  the Foundation then (ACCEPTED interim, ties to TD-140).
- **TD-153** — partner-role least-privilege tidy-ups: (a) UI Delete-student button the backend refuses for partner,
  (b) a few oversight LIST endpoints readable via direct API by partner/reviewer though the UI hides them. (b) → sprint-lane.
- **TD-155** — partner Scholarship view (future): org-scoped bursary applicants for a HalaTuju partner (their own
  referred students, menu hidden when none). Roadmap, not yet built.

**Original 2026-03 audit — code-hygiene leftovers:**
- **TD-050** — i18n key mismatch (quiz reads `halatuju_lang`, not `halatuju_locale` → may always load English) — *medium*.
- **TD-043** — phone/OTP login still "coming soon" (ties to the WhatsApp-OTP plan) — *medium*.
- **TD-018 / 019 / 020 / 021 / 024 / 041 / 047** — duplicate imports, a duplicate serializer key, inline PISMP
  dedup, the `course` column name, the `settings/page.tsx` stub, all-or-nothing startup load — *low*.
- **TD-003** — frontend test coverage (partially resolved) — *low*.

**Long tail (bullet log TD-061–143) — lower priority, verify each entry's own marker:** predominantly
**Tamil-copy first-drafts** (e.g. TD-091/094/096/097/105/108/132), **UI stubs / not-yet-click-tested surfaces**
(TD-070/071/076/092/101/112), **doc-recognition edge cases** (TD-143), and small engine/cleanup items. Some of
these are resolved in follow-up entries — always trust the entry's `✅ RESOLVED` / `Status:` line over this summary.

---

## API Response Format Consistency

### [TD-004] Mixed HTTP status code style ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`
**Resolution:** All raw integer status codes in `SavedCoursesView` and `SavedCourseDetailView` replaced with DRF constants (`status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST`, `status.HTTP_201_CREATED`, `status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND`). Default 200 responses use no explicit status (DRF default).

### [TD-005] No standard error response envelope ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py` (throughout), `halatuju_api/apps/reports/views.py`
**Resolution:** Audited all error responses — already consistently use `{'error': 'message'}` pattern across all endpoints. Frontend catches errors by HTTP status, not response body, so no envelope change needed. Marked as consistent.

### [TD-006] Inconsistent success response keys ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`
**Resolution:** Standardised all list endpoints to use `total_count` instead of `count`. Affected: CourseListView, InstitutionListView, OutcomeListView. Contextual keys (`total_eligible`, `total_ranked`, `total`) left as-is — they match frontend TypeScript types and have specific semantics.

---

## Error Handling Patterns

### [TD-007] Bare except in engine.py merit calculation ✅ RESOLVED (Tech Debt Sprint 4, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/engine.py` (line 191)
**Resolution:** Bare `except:` replaced with specific `except (ValueError, TypeError):` to only catch expected conversion errors.

### [TD-008] ProfileView accepts arbitrary fields without validation ✅ RESOLVED (Security Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/serializers.py`
**Resolution:** Created `ProfileUpdateSerializer` (ModelSerializer for StudentProfile, 19 fields, partial=True). Both `ProfileView.put()` and `ProfileSyncView.post()` now validate via serializer — malformed input returns 400 instead of 500.

### [TD-009] No rate limiting on Gemini API calls ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint 2, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/reports/views.py`
**Resolution:** Added Django cache-based rate limiting (max 3 reports per user per 24 hours). Returns 429 with clear error message when exceeded. Counter increments only after successful generation.

---

## Authentication and Permission Handling

### [TD-010] ~~9 pre-existing auth test failures~~ **RESOLVED (TD-010 Sprint, 2026-03-14)**
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/tests/test_auth.py`, `test_saved_courses.py`, `test_views.py`
**What it was:** 13 tests (not 9 — count was wrong in original audit) failed because they mocked `jwt.decode` but not `jwt.get_unverified_header`, which the middleware calls first. Fixed by adding the missing mock.
**Resolution:** Simple mock fix. Proper auth test infrastructure deferred to admin layer design — see `docs/decisions.md`.

### [TD-011] SupabaseIsAuthenticated returns 403 instead of 401 ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/halatuju/middleware/supabase_auth.py`, `halatuju_api/halatuju/settings/base.py`
**Resolution:** Added `SupabaseAuthentication` DRF authentication class with `authenticate_header()` returning `'Bearer'`. Registered as `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES`. DRF now returns 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header for unauthenticated requests, per RFC 7235. All auth tests updated from 403→401.

### [TD-012] DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES is AllowAny ✅ RESOLVED (Security Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/halatuju/settings/base.py`
**Resolution:** Default changed to `SupabaseIsAuthenticated`. 16 public views explicitly marked with `permission_classes = [AllowAny]`. All 382 tests pass.

---

## Frontend-Backend Implicit Contracts

### [TD-001] STPM SPM prerequisite fields not checked ✅ RESOLVED (Tech Debt Sprint 4, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/stpm_engine.py`
**Resolution:** Added `spm_pass_bi` and `spm_pass_math` to `SIMPLE_CHECKS`. Zero programmes currently set these flags to true, so no eligibility results changed. STPM golden master baseline unchanged at 1,811.

### [TD-002] Client-side eligibility logic duplicated (HIGH RISK) — RESOLVED
**Resolved:** TD-002 Sprint (2026-03-14). Frontend calculation files (`merit.ts`, `stpm.ts`, `pathways.ts` — 596 lines) deleted. Three new backend API endpoints added: `/calculate/merit/`, `/calculate/cgpa/`, `/calculate/pathways/`. Frontend now calls backend for all calculations. `getPathwayFitScore()` ported to `pathways.py`. Backend is the single source of truth.

### [TD-013] Subject key naming split ✅ RESOLVED (Subject Key Unification Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/lib/subjects.ts`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/serializers.py`
**Resolution:** Frontend now sends engine keys directly. `GRADE_KEY_MAP` removed from serializer. `subjects.ts` is the single source of truth with `SPM_SUBJECTS` array. Report engine `SUBJECT_LABELS` fixed (5 wrong keys, 15 added).

### [TD-014] localStorage sprawl with no centralised management ✅ RESOLVED (Frontend Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/lib/storage.ts`
**Resolution:** Created `storage.ts` with 19 named key constants and `clearAll()` helper. All 15 files updated to import constants — zero hardcoded `halatuju_*` strings remain outside storage.ts. Grep-verified.

### [TD-015] Frontend merit calculation sent to backend, backend may recalculate — RESOLVED
**Resolved:** TD-002 Sprint (2026-03-14). Frontend no longer calculates merit locally — it calls `/calculate/merit/` API. Backend is the single source of truth. `merit.ts` deleted.

### [TD-016] StpmProgrammeDetailView looks up institution by name ✅ RESOLVED (Bug Fixes, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/models.py`
**Resolution:** StpmCourse institution FK added. Name-based lookup replaced with proper foreign key relationship.

### [TD-017] Pre-U fit scoring exists only on frontend — RESOLVED
**Resolved:** TD-002 Sprint (2026-03-14). `getPathwayFitScore()` ported to `pathways.py` with 5 tests. `/calculate/pathways/` endpoint returns fit scores. Frontend `pathways.ts` deleted.

---

## Duplicated Logic

### [TD-018] Duplicate import of Count, Subquery, OuterRef
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py` (line 25 and line 354)
**What it is:** `Count, Subquery, OuterRef` are imported at the top of the file (line 25) and then re-imported inside `EligibilityCheckView.post()` (line 354).
**What consistent looks like:** Remove the inline import at line 354.
**Risk if left:** Low — no functional impact.
**Dependencies:** None.

### [TD-019] Inline json import in views.py
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py` (lines 487, 827)
**What it is:** `import json as _json` is done inline inside method bodies at lines 487 and 827, with an underscore prefix to avoid name collision. Also `defaultdict` is imported inline as `_dd` at line 488.
**What consistent looks like:** Import at the top of the file.
**Risk if left:** Low — just code smell.
**Dependencies:** None.

### [TD-020] Duplicate credit_stv key in serializer SPECIAL_FIELDS
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/serializers.py` (lines 75, 88)
**What it is:** `'credit_stv': 'Kredit Sains/Teknikal/Vokasional'` appears twice in the `SPECIAL_FIELDS` dict. In Python, the second silently overwrites the first, so the duplicate is dead code.
**What consistent looks like:** Remove the duplicate at line 88.
**Risk if left:** Low — no functional impact, but misleading.
**Dependencies:** None.

### [TD-021] PISMP deduplication logic in views.py is complex and inline
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py` (lines 481-557)
**What it is:** ~75 lines of PISMP zone-variant deduplication logic is embedded directly inside `EligibilityCheckView.post()`. This includes hash computation, zone detection, language merging — all with inline imports and local function definitions. The method is already ~300 lines long.
**What consistent looks like:** Extract PISMP deduplication to a separate function in a utilities module.
**Risk if left:** Low — works but makes the eligibility endpoint very hard to read and maintain.
**Dependencies:** PISMP eligibility results.

### [TD-022] Eligibility sort logic duplicated between search and eligibility views ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/eligibility_service.py`
**Resolution:** `SOURCE_TYPE_ORDER` extracted to module-level constant in `views.py`. `_PATHWAY_PRIORITY` already module-level in `eligibility_service.py` from Refactoring Sprint. Sorting logic intentionally different between search and eligibility (different use cases) — the fix was extracting inline constants, not unifying the sort.

---

## Naming Conventions

### [TD-023] Model field name vs engine key inconsistencies ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint 2, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/engine.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/apps.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/tests/conftest.py`
**Resolution:** Engine updated to use `three_m_only` directly (matching the model field). Column rename hack removed from `apps.py` and `conftest.py`.

### [TD-024] Course name field is just 'course'
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/models.py` (line 23)
**What it is:** The Course model's name field is called `course` — so you get `course.course` to access the name. Every serializer, view, and template that references the course name reads `c.course` which looks like a self-reference.
**What consistent looks like:** Field should be `name` (yielding `course.name`).
**Risk if left:** Low — functionally fine, but confusing for new contributors.
**Dependencies:** Would require migration + updates to engine, views, serializers, templates, frontend types. Too risky to change now.

### [TD-025] StudentProfile table name uses 'api_' prefix ✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-01)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/models.py`
**What it was:** `db_table = 'api_student_profiles'` — the `api_` prefix was added to avoid collision with the legacy Streamlit `student_profiles` table. The two same-purpose-looking tables were an active footgun: in v2.21.0 a migrate-first `ALTER` silently hit the wrong (legacy 30-row) table instead of the live `api_student_profiles` — caught pre-deploy, but a miss would have 500'd prod.
**Resolution:** Dropped the dead legacy `public.student_profiles` table (30 Streamlit-era rows, 19 cols) via Supabase MCP — **not** a Django-managed table (the model owns `api_student_profiles`), so no migration/deploy. Pre-drop verified: zero incoming FKs, zero live code references (every runtime query uses `api_student_profiles`; bare `student_profiles` only appeared in docs/comments + the historical `courses/0001` migration that `0002` already renamed), zero view/trigger/RLS dependencies. The 30 rows were backed up first to `halatuju_api/docs/backups/student_profiles_legacy_backup_2026-06-01.json` (full schema + data). **The footgun is now gone:** a mistaken raw `ALTER student_profiles` would now error loudly ("relation does not exist") instead of silently succeeding against a real table. The `api_` prefix is retained as the canonical name (a rename was deemed not worth the churn — RLS policies, raw SQL, and migration history all reference `api_student_profiles`).

### [TD-026] Inconsistent response field names for course name ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/serializers.py`
**Resolution:** Added `course_name = CharField(source='course', read_only=True)` to `CourseSerializer`. All endpoints now include `course_name` in responses. `course` field kept for backwards compatibility — frontend can migrate to `course_name` at its own pace.

---

## Bolt-On Code from Pre-Django Migration

### [TD-027] Legacy key mapping still in engine.py ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/engine.py`
**Resolution:** `LEGACY_KEY_MAP` removed. Grep confirmed it was never referenced anywhere in the codebase — dead code from the Streamlit migration.

### [TD-028] CSV data files still in codebase ✅ RESOLVED (Legacy Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/data/stpm/`
**Resolution:** Deleted 4 CSV files. Data lives in Supabase. Created `stpm_courses.json` + `stpm_requirements.json` Django fixtures for tests.

### [TD-029] Legacy Streamlit archive still in repo ✅ RESOLVED (Legacy Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `_archive/streamlit/`
**Resolution:** Deleted 246 files (80MB). Git history serves as the archive.

### [TD-030] Model docstring row counts are stale ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/models.py`
**Resolution:** Removed stale CSV filenames and row counts from all model docstrings. Now reference Supabase table names instead.

---

## Management Commands and Data Integrity Scripts

### [TD-031] One-time scripts still in management commands ✅ RESOLVED (Legacy Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** 6 commands deleted
**Resolution:** Deleted `load_csv_data`, `load_stpm_data`, `enrich_stpm_metadata`, `populate_stpm_urls`, `fix_stpm_names`, `backfill_masco`. Extracted `proper_case_name` and `build_mohe_url` to `apps/courses/utils.py`. 4 recurring commands preserved.
**Dependencies:** None.

### [TD-032] load_csv_data.py references original Streamlit data paths ✅ RESOLVED (Legacy Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/management/commands/load_csv_data.py`
**Resolution:** File deleted (TD-031).

---

## Test Patterns and Coverage Gaps

### [TD-003] Zero frontend tests (LOW RISK) — PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/` (entire frontend)
**What it is:** The Next.js frontend had zero test files. After IC Gate Sprint (2026-03-15), 17 frontend tests exist. Remaining client-side logic is UI rendering and API calls — no business logic after TD-002 Sprint deleted `pathways.ts`, `merit.ts`, and `stpm.ts`.
**What consistent looks like:** Component tests for critical flows (onboarding, dashboard). Nice-to-have, not urgent.
**Risk if left:** LOW — all calculation logic now lives in the backend with 966 tests. Frontend is display-only. Auth flow refactored (2026-03-20) to eliminate localStorage as routing authority, further reducing frontend complexity.
**Dependencies:** Would need Jest/Vitest setup in halatuju-web.

### [TD-033] ~~Auth test failures not triaged~~ **RESOLVED (TD-010 Sprint, 2026-03-14)**
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/tests/test_auth.py`
**What it was:** Auth tests were failing due to incomplete mocking — triaged and fixed as part of TD-010.
**Resolution:** See TD-010 resolution.

### [TD-034] No integration test for full eligibility → ranking → report flow ✅ RESOLVED (External Links & MOHE Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/tests/`
**Resolution:** Integration test added covering the full eligibility → ranking flow with a realistic student profile.

### [TD-035] Golden master count discrepancy ✅ RESOLVED (Test Health Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`
**What it was:** CLAUDE.md referenced golden master baselines as both "8280" and "8283" in different places. The architecture map said 8283.
**Resolution:** Old baseline (8283) was from stale CSV data. Golden master test was silently skipping for months because CSV files were deleted. Converted to DB fixtures, verified baseline is 5319 (matches production Supabase data). All references now say 5319.
**Dependencies:** None.

---

## Configuration and Environment Handling

### [TD-036] Hardcoded fallback SECRET_KEY in base.py ✅ RESOLVED (Security Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/halatuju/settings/production.py`
**Resolution:** `production.py` now raises `ValueError` if `SECRET_KEY` equals the insecure dev default. Dev/test environments still use the fallback for convenience.

### [TD-037] db.sqlite3 in project folder ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/db.sqlite3`
**Resolution:** Deleted the file. Already covered by `.gitignore` (`*.sqlite3`). Django dev settings recreate it on demand if needed.

### [TD-038] CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS possible in production ✅ RESOLVED (Security Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/halatuju/settings/production.py`
**Resolution:** `production.py` now raises `ValueError` if `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*`. Must set explicit origin list.

### [TD-039] sentry-sdk pinned to <2.0 ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint 2, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/requirements.txt`
**Resolution:** Pin relaxed to `sentry-sdk>=1.39,<3.0`. Allows upgrade to 2.x when ready.

### [TD-040] numpy pinned to <2.0 ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint 2, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/requirements.txt`
**Resolution:** Pin relaxed to `numpy>=1.24,<3.0`. Allows upgrade to 2.x when ready. Only used via pandas.

---

## Missing Features / Stubs

### [TD-041] settings/page.tsx is a stub
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/app/settings/page.tsx`
**What it is:** The settings page only has a "Reset All Data" button that clears localStorage. No account management, no notification preferences, no data export.
**What consistent looks like:** Either flesh out with real settings or remove the nav link until ready.
**Risk if left:** Low — users see a nearly empty page.
**Dependencies:** None.

### [TD-042] No error.tsx, loading.tsx, or not-found.tsx pages ✅ RESOLVED (Frontend Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/app/error.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`
**Resolution:** Three pages added with full i18n (EN/MS/TA via `useT()`), primary brand colour, consistent layout. 7 translation keys added to `errors` section in all message files.

### [TD-043] Phone/OTP login blocked with "coming soon"
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/app/login/page.tsx`
**What it is:** Phone number login shows a "coming soon" message. Only Google OAuth works. This limits accessibility for students who don't have Google accounts.
**What consistent looks like:** WhatsApp OTP plan exists (`docs/plans/2026-03-09-whatsapp-otp-plan.md`) but not implemented.
**Risk if left:** Medium — blocks users without Google accounts.
**Dependencies:** Twilio/WhatsApp integration, ~RM12/month cost.

---

## Performance and Architecture

### [TD-044] EligibilityCheckView iterates entire DataFrame on every request ✅ RESOLVED (Refactoring Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/eligibility_service.py`
**Resolution:** Double DataFrame iteration eliminated during extraction to eligibility_service.py. PISMP deduplication now operates on the result list, not the DataFrame.

### [TD-045] EligibilityCheckView.post() is 300+ lines ✅ RESOLVED (Refactoring Sprint, 2026-03-14)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/eligibility_service.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`
**Resolution:** Extracted 5 pure functions into `eligibility_service.py`: `compute_student_merit()`, `compute_course_merit()`, `deduplicate_pismp()`, `sort_eligible_courses()`, `compute_stats()`. View reduced from ~310 lines to ~100 lines. 19 unit tests added for the service module.

### [TD-046] CourseListView returns all 389 courses with no pagination ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint 2, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/views.py`
**Resolution:** Added optional pagination via `?page=1&page_size=50` query params. Backwards-compatible: no params returns all results as before. Max page size capped at 100.

### [TD-047] Startup data load is all-or-nothing
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/apps.py` (lines 30-50)
**What it is:** `CoursesConfig.ready()` loads all data at startup. If the database connection fails or tables don't exist, it logs a warning and the app starts with empty DataFrames. The first eligibility check then returns 503.
**What consistent looks like:** Health check endpoint that verifies data is loaded, with automatic retry.
**Risk if left:** Low — Cloud Run containers restart if they fail health checks.
**Dependencies:** None.

---

## Frontend-Specific Issues

### [TD-048] console.error calls in production code ✅ RESOLVED (Frontend Cleanup Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** All frontend pages
**Resolution:** All `console.error` calls replaced with `useToast()` hook providing user-facing toast notifications. Zero console.error/log/warn calls remain in production code. Toast system (`ToastProvider` + `useToast()`) added in Saved Courses Sprint 2.

### [TD-049] `as any` type assertion in profile page ✅ RESOLVED (Quick Wins Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/app/profile/page.tsx`, `halatuju-web/src/lib/api.ts`
**Resolution:** Extended `StudentProfile.colorblind`/`disability` to accept `'Ya' | 'Tidak'` union type (backend format). Typed gender/nationality state vars with literal types. Removed `as any`. **UPDATE (i18n & Bug Fixes Sprint, 2026-03-19):** Backend converted to BooleanField, frontend types updated to `boolean`. Union type removed — booleans flow end-to-end with zero conversion layers.

### [TD-050] i18n locale key inconsistency
**File(s):** `halatuju-web/src/lib/i18n.tsx`, `halatuju-web/src/app/quiz/page.tsx` (lines 40, 149)
**What it is:** The i18n system uses `halatuju_locale` localStorage key, but the quiz page reads `halatuju_lang` (which doesn't exist — it will always get the default 'en'). These are different keys.
**What consistent looks like:** Use one key consistently. The quiz should use the i18n context's locale, not a separate localStorage read.
**Risk if left:** Medium — quiz may always load in English regardless of the user's language setting.
**Dependencies:** Quiz page, i18n context.

### [TD-051] STPM field metadata has 207 unique values ✅ RESOLVED (Field Taxonomy Sprint 2, 2026-03-16)
**File(s):** Database (stpm_courses.field_key_id column)
**Resolution:** Deterministic classifier maps all 1,113 STPM courses to 29 of 37 canonical taxonomy keys via `classify_stpm_course()`. The 207 raw `field` values are superseded by `field_key_id` FK to `field_taxonomy`. Search/detail APIs now return `field_key` and support `?field_key=` filtering.

### [TD-052] Hardcoded merit colour thresholds duplicated ✅ RESOLVED (API Consistency Sprint, 2026-03-15)
**File(s):** `halatuju_api/apps/courses/engine.py`, `halatuju_api/apps/courses/eligibility_service.py`
**Resolution:** Backend merit thresholds extracted to named constants. `engine.py`: `MERIT_GAP_HIGH`, `MERIT_GAP_FAIR`, `MERIT_COLORS` dict. `eligibility_service.py`: `MATRIC_HIGH_THRESHOLD`, `MATRIC_FAIR_THRESHOLD` (already existed), `MERIT_HIGH`/`FAIR`/`LOW` tuples now derived from `engine.MERIT_COLORS`. Frontend thresholds in matric/STPM pages left as-is — the matric page uses `/calculate/pathways/` API response which includes labels, and the STPM detail page threshold (80/60) is for average merit display (different context).

- TD-039, TD-040: Update dependency pins

**B40 Redesign (found Sprint 7, 2026-05-23)**
- TD-053: Reconcile the NRIC-gate whitelist — `middleware/supabase_auth.py` `NRIC_GATE_EXACT` omits `/api/v1/profile/sync/`, but `docs/decisions.md` + `test_nric_gate` describe sync as whitelisted. Suite green (no breakage); align code/docs/tests.
- ~~TD-054~~: **RESOLVED — S11a (2026-05-24).** NRIC uniqueness is now enforced at the admin verify-&-accept point (`AdminVerifyAcceptView` returns `409 nric_conflict` if another profile already has that NRIC verified), per the soft-NRIC "clash surfaces at verification" design. The old claim transfer-path collision is no longer the uniqueness mechanism.

**B40 Redesign (found Sprint 9, 2026-05-24)**
- TD-055: Apply submit overwrites the whole `profile.guardians` list with the single `{name, phone}` entry from My Family. Fine today (guardians collected nowhere else), but if a future flow stores multiple/richer guardians, the apply form would clobber them. Merge-by-index or key on relationship when guardians become multi-entry.
- ~~TD-056~~: **RESOLVED — 2026-05-28.** All real partner-org codes in the /apply dropdown now have backing `PartnerOrganisation` rows seeded on prod via Supabase MCP: `smc`, `cumig`, `ewrf`, `hyo`, `mhm`, `sathya_sai`, `tara`, `hss`, `pptm` (9 total — 6 added with the new-orgs-pass in 8d6a07b, then the remaining 3 in a cleanup pass the same day). The `referred_by_org` FK now links cleanly for any of those selections. The remaining dropdown codes (`pushparani`, `govind`, `halatuju`, `social`, `other`) are intentionally **NOT** in `partner_organisations` — they're individual coordinators, self-referral, or generic catch-alls, not organisations. For those, `referral_source` carries the raw code and `referred_by_org` stays null by design. Original finding ↓ — TD-056: Seed `PartnerOrganisation` rows for the named referring-orgs (smc, cumig, pushparani, sathya_sai, halatuju, tara, govind). Until seeded, a selection persists as `referral_source` (raw code) but does **not** link the `referred_by_org` FK. Add a seed/data-migration (or admin entries) before launch so partner attribution works.
- TD-057: The apply→onboarding "return" marker (`halatuju_apply_return`, sessionStorage) can go stale if the student **abandons** the results-edit detour mid-flow and then starts a *normal* onboarding in the same tab — the final step would wrongly route to `/scholarship/apply` instead of `/dashboard`. Mitigated (orphan cleared on any normal apply-page visit; sessionStorage clears on tab close) but not eliminated for the abandon→dashboard→onboarding path. Clean fix: thread the return intent as a query param through the onboarding steps instead of a persistent flag, or clear the marker on a dashboard visit.

**B40 Plans redesign (found P5 ship, 2026-05-27)**
- TD-058: The **prod DB has no `django_content_type` / auth tables** (the contenttypes/admin apps' tables were never created on this Supabase instance). Harmless today — the app doesn't use contenttypes/admin/permissions at runtime, and additive `ADD COLUMN` migrations succeed — but `manage.py migrate` **exits non-zero** (the `post_migrate` create_contenttypes/create_permissions signal errors), and **any future migration that creates a new model (or code relying on contenttypes/permissions) would fail in prod**. Fix before such a migration: run `migrate contenttypes` + `migrate auth` against prod (or `migrate --run-syncdb`) to create the missing tables, after confirming no clash. Until then, treat a non-zero migrate exit as "verify the schema directly," not "it failed". (See lessons.md + retrospective-b40-plans-redesign.md.) **Status: MANAGED, not fixed.** The MCP migrate-first workaround is the standing practice and has fully absorbed this — we apply the migration's DDL + INSERT the `django_migrations` row via Supabase MCP `execute_sql` in one transaction (replicating what Django's executor would do), which never invokes `post_migrate`, so there's no non-zero exit and no contenttypes dependency. **This now covers NEW-MODEL migrations too, not just additive `ADD COLUMN`:** a new model is applied as a raw `CREATE TABLE` (+ RLS deny-by-default + the `django_migrations` row) — proven repeatedly, incl. `scholarship 0011` (additive, v2.3.0) and the new-model migrations **`0031` (E1a Sponsor), `0033` (E2a anon-pool cols), `0034` (E3a Donation/Sponsorship)** this Phase-E cycle. So the earlier caveat that "a new-model migration still needs the contenttypes/auth tables created first" is **superseded** — raw `CREATE TABLE` doesn't touch contenttypes, so we never created those tables and don't need to. **The only thing that still bites:** someone runs `manage.py migrate` for a new model **without** the workaround (e.g. a CI/local migrate against prod) — the `post_migrate` `create_contenttypes`/`create_permissions` signal would error. Real fix (if ever wanted): `migrate contenttypes` + `migrate auth` (or `--run-syncdb`) against prod once, after confirming no clash — but as long as every schema change goes through MCP migrate-first, this never fires. Treat a non-zero `migrate` exit as "verify the schema directly," not "it failed".
- ~~TD-060~~: **RESOLVED — S5c (v2.4.6, 2026-05-28).** `profile_engine._build_prompt` rebuilt to the current (profile-canonical) data model + "Your story" narrative + simplified funding (no dead `total`) + referees, and made language-aware (understands Malay/English/Tamil input; output in a target language, default applicant locale, admin EN/BM selector). New `test_profile_engine.py` includes the no-`AttributeError`-on-current-model regression. Original finding ↓ — TD-060: **The AI sponsor-profile generator (`apps/scholarship/profile_engine.py`) is stale and would error if invoked.** `_build_prompt` reads `application.qualification` / `spm_a_count` / `household_income` / `stpm_pngk` — all **removed** from the model by the profile-canonical refactor (now live on `StudentProfile`) — plus legacy/dead fields `intended_pathway` (→ `pathways_considered`/`chosen_programme`), `fears`, `justification`, and `fn.total` (TD-059). `_build_prompt` runs **before** the try/except in `generate_sponsor_profile`, so a real call (with `GEMINI_API_KEY` set) raises `AttributeError` → `AdminGenerateProfileView` 500s. **Masked today** because the programme is dormant and Phase-2 sponsor profiles aren't live (without a key it returns "not configured" before `_build_prompt`). Also English-only by design. **Fix = S5c:** rewrite `_build_prompt` to profile-canonical fields (`profile.exam_type`, `count_spm_a_grades`, `profile.stpm_cgpa`, `profile.household_income/size`, `receives_str/jkm`) + new story fields (`first_in_family`, `parents_occupation`, `family_context`, `daily_life`, `aspirations`, `plans`) + new funding (`categories`/`funding_note`/`programme_months`, not `total`) + referees; and make it **Tamil/BM-aware** (target-language param; handle Tamil/BM narrative input). Found during S5b scoping (2026-05-28).
- ~~TD-059~~: **RESOLVED — v2.4.7, 2026-05-28.** Dropped on prod via Supabase MCP under the expand-contract pattern (new code deployed first so the live `FundingNeedSerializer` no longer exposed the columns, then `ALTER TABLE funding_needs DROP COLUMN ×9` + `django_migrations` row for `0015_drop_funding_amount_fields`). 0 rows pre-drop confirmed. `funding_needs` now has exactly 7 columns: `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `application_id`, `categories`, `funding_note`, `programme_months`. `FundingNeedSerializer.fields` shrunk to the 3 kept; `total` property + frontend `DetailsFormState` amount fields + `fundingTotal` helper + admin `RM${funding_need.total}` display all gone. Original finding ↓ — TD-059: **`FundingNeed` legacy amount columns are dead after the S3 funding reframe (v2.4.2).** `tuition_gap`, `laptop`, `hostel`, `transport`, `books`, `other`, `monthly_allowance`, `allowance_months` (+ the `total` property) are no longer written or rendered — the funding tab now uses `categories`/`funding_note`/`programme_months` only. Kept in place (additive migration `0013`, 0 prod rows) to avoid a non-backward-compatible drop mid-redesign. Cleanup: once the redesign ships fully (post-S5), drop the dead columns in one migration + remove them from `FundingNeedSerializer`/`DetailsFormState`/`fundingTotal`. Low risk (no data, no readers).

- TD-061: **/profile + /application schema consolidation — drop 4 dead columns** (`StudentProfile.family_income`, `StudentProfile.siblings`, `StudentProfile.phone`, **`ScholarshipApplication.siblings_studying`**). The first three were replaced 2026-05-29 (S14) by their canonical equivalents on the profile (`household_income`, `household_size`, `contact_phone`); the fourth was replaced 2026-05-29 (S15) by `ScholarshipApplication.siblings_studying_count` which captures the actual number rather than just a yes/no signal. Frontend stopped writing all four dead columns and the backfills have run: `household_income` populated from `family_income` range midpoints (41 rows), `household_size = siblings + 2` where missing (42 rows), `phone` promotion was a no-op (the 6 dead-phone rows all already have `contact_phone`); `siblings_studying_count` backfill was a no-op (0 applications had `siblings_studying = TRUE` at the time the new column landed). Old columns kept these sprints to keep the migrations backward-compatible during deploy. **Next session:** destructive migration + serializer cleanup, expand-contract pattern (deploy-first / DROP-after), zero data loss expected. Touches: `ProfileUpdateSerializer.Meta.fields` (3 cols), `ProfileView.get` response keys (3 cols), `ApplicationDetailsUpdateSerializer` (1 col), `_DEEPER_FIELDS` (1 col), `ApplicationReadSerializer` fields (1 col), `profile_engine._siblings_studying_display` (drop the boolean fallback), `api.ts` types (4 cols), the courses `StudentProfile` + scholarship `ScholarshipApplication` models, and two drop migrations (one per app).
  - ✅ **RESOLVED (v2.14.0, 2026-05-30).** Dropped all four columns under expand-contract (deploy-first / DROP-after; migrations `courses/0050` + `scholarship/0022` applied via Supabase MCP after the no-field revision went live). Repointed every reader/writer to the canonical fields (the "expand" step had never actually been finished — these columns were still wired into `/profile` GET + update serializer, both admin serializers, the CSV export, the AI prompt, and several FE consumers). **Fixed a latent bug found in the process:** `/profile` read/wrote `household_income`/`household_size` but the GET response + `ProfileUpdateSerializer` still listed the *legacy* `family_income`/`siblings`, so `/profile` edits to household income/size were silently dropped — only `/apply` could write them. Full backend 1249 pass; jest 155; build clean. See `docs/decisions.md`.

- TD-062: **Orphaned Supabase Storage blobs from pre-fix doc deletions.** Before today's single-instance-doc fix, the `DELETE /api/v1/scholarship/documents/<id>/` endpoint dropped the DB row but did NOT sweep the corresponding object in the `b40-documents` private bucket. Elanjelian's test account left ~3-4 orphan IC blobs (storage_paths matching the deleted doc IDs 1, 3, 4); other applicants who clicked Remove similarly leaked. The going-forward path is now clean (both DELETE and the new single-instance replace path call `storage.delete_objects`), so this only covers historical leaks. Cheap: write a one-shot management command that lists every object in the bucket via the Supabase Storage REST API and deletes any whose path doesn't correspond to an existing `applicant_documents.storage_path` row. Storage is cheap so this is low priority — flagging so we don't forget when we look at storage costs.
  - ✅ **RESOLVED (v2.14.0, 2026-05-30).** Built `manage.py cleanup_orphan_blobs` (+ `storage.list_objects` helper): walks the bucket, diffs leaf paths against `ApplicantDocument.storage_path`, dry-run by default / `--apply` to delete. 3 tests (mocked Storage). Running `--apply` against prod to actually purge the historical orphans is a separate manual step — the tool is in place.
  - ✅ **PURGE RUN — fully closed (2026-06-01).** Swept the historical orphans against prod. To dodge the wrong-DB footgun entirely, the diff used the known-paths set pulled from the **prod DB via Supabase MCP** (not a local DB connection) and listed the bucket via the Storage REST API (service-role key read from the live `halatuju-api` Cloud Run env, never written to disk). Dry-run cross-checked clean: **49 KNOWN** (= the prod `applicant_documents` count exactly) · 55 bucket objects · 49 matched · **6 orphans, all under `3/` (Elanjelian test account)** — 5×`ic` + 1×`parent_ic`, ~198 KB JPEGs, no DB row. Deleted all 6 after explicit user sign-off; re-verify showed **49 bucket objects / 0 orphans**. No backup taken — already-orphaned IC images from a test account, and copying PII to local disk would be worse than deleting. The going-forward delete path was already clean, so no recurrence is expected. _Original footgun for the record: orphans = `bucket objects − ApplicantDocument rows in the CONNECTED DB`, so `cleanup_orphan_blobs --apply` with the storage key set but the DB pointed anywhere other than prod would flag every real document as an orphan — always dry-run and eyeball before `--apply`._

- TD-063: **SPM stream pools are duplicated across the FE/BE boundary** (`SPM_STREAM_POOLS` in `halatuju-web/src/lib/subjects.ts` and `SCIENCE_POOL`/`ARTS_POOL`/`TECHNICAL_POOL` in `halatuju_api/apps/courses/engine.py`). They must stay identical — a stream subject present in the dropdown but absent from the backend pool silently scores on the 10% elective weight (Sec3) instead of the 30% stream weight (Sec2). Mitigated S18 with a linking code comment on both definitions + paired count tests (jest `subjects.test.ts`: 38 arts/16 technical; pytest `test_merit_pools.py`: same). (Found S18, 2026-05-29)
  - ✅ **RESOLVED (v2.13.0, 2026-05-30).** The duplication existed only because the back-end re-derived the stream from a flat grades dict (no label), which forced it to keep its own copy of the pools to *guess* the stream by counting. Fixed by passing the student's explicit stream/aliran selection: `prepare_merit_inputs(grades, stream_subjects=None)` uses the designated subjects for Sec2 when present (pools NOT consulted → a missing-from-pool subject can no longer be mis-scored), and falls back to the count-heuristic only for old/unlabelled data. New `StudentProfile.stream_subjects` (migration `courses/0049`); FE sends `aliranSubjects` to every merit call + persists on sync. **The pools are now fallback-only**, so the drift risk no longer reaches a labelled student — the original S18 bug class is impossible for them. Linking comment + count tests kept for the fallback path. Verified: golden master unchanged (5319) + 6 differential unit tests in `test_merit_pools.py`. See `docs/decisions.md`.

- TD-064: **`PartnerAdmin.is_super_admin` kept alongside the new `role` field (expand-contract).** Phase C (v2.15.0) added `role ∈ {super, reviewer, viewer}` and backfilled it from `is_super_admin`, but kept the legacy boolean because several call sites still read it (`get_partner_students`, `AdminRoleView`, dashboards). An `is_super` bridge property + `has_role()` helper paper over the duality. **To resolve:** migrate every `is_super_admin` reader to `role`/`is_super`, then drop the boolean (additive→destructive migration, expand-contract). Low priority; the bridge is safe. (Introduced Phase C, 2026-05-30)
- TD-065: **Admin interview/Phase-C flow has no jest component tests.** The capture UI, accept-gate UI, assignment, and confirm button are covered only by `next build` type-checking + backend pytest — jest is render-only for these admin pages (longstanding repo gap, surfaced again by Phase C). The interactive behaviour (verdict binding, gate disabling, draft/submit) is unverified at the component level. **To resolve:** add component tests for the interview capture form + accept-gate. Low priority. (Surfaced Phase C, 2026-05-30) **Extended v2.17.0:** the new gap-spotter UI (suggest button → render → gap→findings capture merge) and the student doc-assist chip (`vision_fields.student_verdict`) are likewise jest-untested — only `next build` typing + backend pytest cover them. Same remediation. **Extended v2.18.0:** the Phase-D "Refine with interview findings (AI)" button + final-profile panel are also jest-untested (backend pytest + `next build` typing only). **Extended v2.19.0:** the reject-bucket UI (Decline-after-review / Decline-contractual buttons + confirm + rejection badge) is likewise jest-untested. **Extended v2.20.0:** the `DocumentHelpCoach` widget (loading shimmer / AI message / i18n fallback render + fetch effect) is jest-untested at the component level — though its *pure* decision logic (`lib/documentHelp.ts` `shouldShowCoach`/`fallbackKeyFor`) IS node-env unit-tested (8 tests), so only the render/effect wiring relies on `next build` typing. Same remediation. **Extended v2.22.0:** the sponsor portal (`/sponsor`, 6-state render off `getSponsorMe()` + the register form) and the admin vetting table (`/admin/sponsors` approve/reject/suspend) are jest-untested — `next build` typing + backend pytest only. (The `actionsFor(status)` helper in `/admin/sponsors` is pure and could be unit-tested if extracted.) Same remediation. **Extended v2.23.0:** the sponsor auth pages (`/sponsor/login`, `/sponsor/register`, the portal complete-details form) are component-untested — though the pure password-rule + source logic (`lib/sponsorAuth.ts` `checkPassword`/`SPONSOR_SOURCES`) IS node-env unit-tested (6 tests), so only the form render/effect + Supabase-auth wiring relies on `next build` typing. Same remediation. **Extended v2.25.0:** the pool frontend (`/sponsor` browse grid, `/sponsor/pool/[id]` detail, the admin "Anonymous profile" card) is render-only and jest-untested — `next build` typing + the backend `test_sponsor_pool.py` (incl. the allowlist leak tests = the load-bearing guarantee) cover it; the FE just renders the allowlist payload. Plus E2 (both tiers) is **not click-tested** — the grid only renders with the flag on + dummy data + sponsor/admin sessions (headless can't; do the local smoke before flipping the flag — TD-070). **UNBLOCKED 2026-07-10 (reviewer/sponsor bug batch):** the web app now HAS a component-test harness (jest-environment-jsdom + @testing-library/react; per-file `/** @jest-environment jsdom */` docblock so the global node env is untouched; `tsconfig.jest.json` sets `jsx: react-jsx`) — first use is `sponsor/(portal)/students/[id]/page.test.tsx` (fund→refresh regression). The "jest is render-only / no harness" blocker is gone; the specific admin/sponsor pages listed above are still to be covered (now possible, no longer infra-blocked). Same remediation, now unblocked.

- TD-066: **Temporary tech-support box on /application is marked `TEMP` and must be removed.** A testing-only support box ("Email tamiliam@gmail.com or call 012-337 5709…") sits in the /application left step menu (mobile fallback below the content). It was added during the live-test phase so a stuck student has a human to reach; it is **not** intended for the promoted programme. Every instance is tagged `TEMP` in code for grep-and-remove. **To resolve:** delete all `TEMP`-marked tech-support box markup + its i18n keys once live testing concludes. Low effort, just don't forget. (Introduced v2.17.0, 2026-05-31)

- TD-067: **The Phase-D final profile (`SponsorProfile.final_markdown`) has no edit/publish/reader path.** v2.18.0 added the refined "v2" profile, but: (a) it's display-only on the admin page — unlike the draft (editable textarea + Save + Publish), the final can only be regenerated, not hand-tweaked; (b) the existing `publish` endpoint publishes `current_markdown` (draft/edited), not `final_markdown`; (c) its intended reader — the sponsor — has no portal yet (Phase E). So today the final profile is an admin-visible artefact with no downstream consumer. **To resolve in Phase E:** decide whether the sponsor reads `final_markdown` directly or whether an admin reviews/edits/publishes it first (likely the latter — add a finalised-edit + publish-final path mirroring the draft's), then wire the sponsor view to the published final. Deliberately deferred — building the reader before Phase E would be a door into an empty room (see decisions.md, the sponsor-login decision). (Introduced v2.18.0, 2026-05-31) **Resolved-in-direction v2.24.0 (E2a):** the sponsor's reader is now a SEPARATE *generated anonymous* profile (`SponsorProfile.anon_markdown`, admin generate→publish), **not** `final_markdown` — so `final_markdown` stays purely admin-facing context, and the "who reads it" question is answered (nobody downstream; sponsors read the anon blurb). **Remaining nuance:** the anon profile is generated from the *application form data*, so it does NOT yet fold in the Phase-D *interview findings* that `final_markdown` captures. Future enhancement: generate the anon profile from the refined final (anonymised) so interview insight reaches sponsors. Low priority.

- TD-068: **Contractual rejection (bucket 4) has no admin-typed reason or post-award capture flow.** v2.19.0 shipped the `contractual` category + a "Decline (contractual)" button on accepted students, but: (a) it sends the **generic** decline email — the user's spec ("email will say the reason specified by admin") was explicitly deferred, so there is no reason text box and the student isn't told why; (b) there's no structured trigger for *when* a contractual rejection applies — no capture of the signed-document / bank-account state, no sign-by deadline or reminder, so an admin just decides manually. **To resolve:** add an admin reason field on `admin_reject`/`AdminRejectView` (reuse the `send_request_info_email(note=…)` pattern → a contractual email template that inserts the reason) and design the post-award contractual workflow (account-number capture, sign-by deadline, auto-reminders). Deferred per the user at build time. (Introduced v2.19.0, 2026-05-31)

- TD-069: **STPM flow's SPM-prerequisite electives aren't durably persisted and stay capped at 2.** v2.21.0 fixed the main SPM grades flow (new `elective_subjects` field + cap 7), but the STPM onboarding flow (`onboarding/stpm-grades`) uses a *separate* subsystem for the SPM prerequisites a STPM student enters: grades go to `spm_prereq_grades` (a distinct field) and the elective *selection* lives only in hardcoded localStorage (`halatuju_spm_elektif` / `halatuju_spm_aliran`) — never synced, never re-hydrated — so it has the same logout/login loss the main flow just fixed, and its elective slots are still capped at 2 (`spmElektifSlots.length < 2`). **To resolve:** mirror v2.21.0 for the STPM path — add a `spm_elective_subjects` field, sync + hydrate it, and raise the cap with `MAX_SPM_ELECTIVES`. Explicitly left out of v2.21.0 ("Don't touch STPM" — user). (Introduced v2.21.0, 2026-05-31)

- TD-070: **Phase E Sprint E1 (sponsor portal + admin vetting) is not click-tested interactively.** v2.22.0 is test-green (1408 pytest + 172 jest, `next build` clean) but the two genuinely stateful flows can't run headless: (a) the sponsor **Google-OAuth sign-in** on `/sponsor` (then the round-trip back via `KEY_SPONSOR_SIGNIN` → `/auth/callback` → `/sponsor`), and (b) the **admin approve/reject/suspend** on `/admin/sponsors` (needs a real admin session; the reviewer-vs-viewer 403 gate is backend-tested but the button wiring isn't). Per the logged lesson "test-green ≠ click-tested for a multi-screen stateful flow facing imminent users", this needs a live smoke **before E2 exposes anything to real sponsors**. **To resolve:** run the manual smoke in the "Next Sprint" step 0 (register → pending → approve → approved shell; confirm a viewer admin is blocked). No code; a verification gate. (Introduced v2.22.0, 2026-05-31) **Extended v2.23.0:** the surface grew — sponsor **email/password sign-up + sign-in** (`/sponsor/register` → `/sponsor/login`, incl. the email-confirmation gap → complete-details), the **Google → complete-details** path, **forgot-password**, and the landing-nav `Log in ▾ | Sign Up` cluster are all headless-untestable. The step-0 smoke now also covers these. Note: if the Supabase project has **email confirmation enabled**, a brand-new email/password sponsor won't get a session at sign-up (the "confirm your email" screen shows) and the row is created only after they confirm + complete details — verify the real project setting during the smoke.

- TD-071: **Cloudflare Turnstile (anti-bot) deferred on sponsor signup.** The user's mockup showed a Turnstile widget on the sponsor registration form; v2.23.0 ships without it (email confirmation + admin vetting gate fake sponsors for now). **To resolve when bot-signups become a concern:** create a Cloudflare Turnstile site (free) for halatuju.xyz, set the site key + secret, and enable Supabase Auth's built-in CAPTCHA (hCaptcha/Turnstile) — the form already has the consent/submit structure; the widget slots in above the submit button and the token is passed to `signUp({ options: { captchaToken } })`. (Deferred per user, v2.23.0, 2026-05-31)

- TD-072: **Sponsor phone is Malaysian-only + the old `/sponsor/register-interest` page is now orphaned.** (a) The sponsor register/complete-details phone input is a fixed `🇲🇾 +60` prefix with `formatPhone`/`isValidPhone` (Malaysian formats) — no country picker, so an international sponsor can't enter a non-MY number. If/when overseas sponsors are onboarded, add a country selector (or a phone-input lib) and relax `isValidPhone`. (b) ✅ **RESOLVED (v2.26.1, 2026-06-01).** The orphaned `app/sponsor/register-interest/page.tsx` (v2.16 public lead form → `SponsorInterest` model + admin list) and its entire stack have been **deleted** (Option B — full removal): the page, `submitSponsorInterest` API helper, the `sponsorInterest.*` i18n block (en/ms/ta), `SponsorInterestView` + `AdminSponsorInterestView` + their two routes, `SponsorInterestSerializer`, the `SponsorInterest` model, and `test_sponsor_interest.py`. Table `sponsor_interests` (0 rows) dropped via migration `0035_remove_sponsor_interest` (applied deploy-first). `emails.send_sponsor_interest_admin_email` kept — now shared by the live `SponsorRegisterView`. (Resolved v2.26.1, 2026-06-01) — _(a) MY-only sponsor phone remains open below._ (Introduced v2.23.0, 2026-05-31)

- TD-073: **The student `AuthProvider` (and its Supabase client) is mounted globally — incl. under `/admin/*` and `/sponsor/*`.** `app/providers.tsx` wraps the whole app, so the student client initialises on the admin/sponsor login + callback pages and **auto-anonymous-signs-in** there (a throwaway anon `auth.users` row, swept by the `purge-anon-users` cron) and, on `/admin/auth/callback` / `/sponsor/auth/callback`, **attempts** to read the `?code` it didn't initiate (a harmless local "code verifier not found" — no session claimed, no server call, thanks to PKCE). The **leak itself is fixed** (v2.23.1, PKCE) — this is only residual noise. **Partly addressed v2.23.2:** the most visible symptom (the student `AuthGateModal` "Create Your Free Student Account" overlaying `/admin` + `/sponsor`) is now closed — the modal route-guards via `usePathname` and renders nothing on those paths. **Still residual:** the student `AuthProvider` + client themselves still mount under `/admin` + `/sponsor` (anon-session creation + a harmless failed-exchange log). **Belt-and-suspenders if it ever matters:** scope the student `AuthProvider` so it doesn't mount under `/admin` + `/sponsor` (e.g. route-group layouts), and/or set `detectSessionInUrl: false` on the student client with an explicit `exchangeCodeForSession` on `/auth/callback`. Low priority — PKCE already closes the security hole and the modal overlay is fixed. (Introduced/observed v2.23.1; modal overlay fixed v2.23.2, 2026-05-31)

- TD-074: **Sponsor-pool follow-ups (E2a, low priority, all behind the OFF flag).** (a) **Detail keyed by raw application id** — `GET /api/v1/sponsor/pool/<id>/` uses the DB row id (the card exposes `id` for the fetch). It's non-identifying and the endpoint returns 404 unless the student is currently pool-eligible, but it leaks row count/order to a vetted sponsor. If that matters, switch the API key to the opaque `pool_ref` (needs a ref→id resolver). (b) ✅ **RESOLVED (v2.25.1, 2026-06-01).** The anon-profile generator is fed the student's free-text narrative, which *could* echo a name/school/place. Now there is a **structural** backstop on top of the prompt instruction + admin review + allowlist card: `pool.scan_anon_for_identifiers(text, profile)` scans the generated blurb for the student's own identifying tokens (name/school distinctive tokens, city, NRIC, phone, email), and `AdminPublishAnonProfileView` **refuses to publish** (`400 anon_identifier_leak` + the offending `fields`) when it finds any — the admin must regenerate first. Generic school-type words (SMK/Sekolah/Menengah/…) and name connectors (bin/binti/a-l/…) are stoplisted to avoid false positives; the scan errs toward blocking. (7 tests in `test_sponsor_pool.py`.) (c) **No filters yet** on the browse list (state/field) — fine for a small dummy pool; add when the pool grows. (Introduced v2.24.0, 2026-05-31)

- TD-075: **Phase E3 — the money + the rest of the sponsorship flow (deferred; built dark on mocked money in E3a).** v2.26.0 shipped the wallet/match/consent *state machine* on dummy data, but deliberately not the regulated/operational money parts:
  - **(a) Real toyyibPay donation-in.** `SponsorDonateView` is a **MOCK** (`POST /sponsor/wallet/donate/` just creates a `Donation` row, `reference='mock'`). Wire toyyibPay (FPX) properly: create-bill → redirect → callback verifies → `Donation` credited; the donation terms (**final, non-refundable to bank — sponsor can only redirect the balance within the platform**) must be in the donation flow + the lawyer's brief, and a one-receipt-at-donation-time (LHDN) approach if myNADI has the status.
  - **(b) Disbursement-out + tranches.** The award is currently funded as one block. Build the **tranche schedule** (e.g. RM1,000 ×3: one on acceptance, the rest progress-gated) with admin **release / withhold**; a withheld tranche **voids the contract** and **returns that amount to the sponsor's balance** (the `Sponsorship.amount` stops fully holding — model a per-tranche state). Real payout to the institution is the gated outbound step.
  - **(c) The lapse cron.** `sponsorship.lapse_expired_offers()` exists + is unit-tested but **isn't scheduled**. **REWORKED (go-live transition, Sprint T1, 2026-07-19):** the function no longer follows the dead offer+14d semantics. It now only lapses an offer whose `accept_deadline` was **ARMED** (set when the sign-invitation email was actually sent, `now + SIGN_ACCEPT_DEADLINE_DAYS`, cleared when the agreement binds) — a NULL deadline is never a candidate — and it **REFUSES to lapse any application with a released disbursement** (returns it in `flagged` for admin review instead of pulling money out from under the grandfather cohort). It now returns `{'lapsed': n, 'flagged': [ids]}`, not an int. **The cron may ONLY EVER be scheduled against THESE semantics, and only after the go-live cohort has signed** (owner decision, per `docs/plans/2026-07-19-contract-golive-transition-plan.md`). Wiring it unchanged/early would lapse live awards — do NOT wire a Cloud Scheduler job for it before that.
  - **(d) Partial / multi-sponsor funding.** 1:1 full-or-nothing now (DB `uniq_holding_sponsorship_per_app`). The many-sponsor-to-a-target plumbing is in the shape (per-sponsor allocation amounts); opening it up means partial pledges + a target-vs-sum + a funding deadline + "what if some-but-not-enough" (the user deferred this to avoid the time-boxed wait).
  - **(e) Award / decline letters.** The "award letter" + "decline letter" are state transitions only right now — no emails yet. Add `send_award_email` / `send_award_lapsed_email` (reuse `emails.py`, best-effort) when the flow goes live.
  - **(f) Future:** the 2-year allocation window (then myNADI reallocates); and the E3 tables were created via raw MCP CREATE TABLE (migrate-first), so their FK **constraint names** differ from Django's — harmless, but a future migration that alters/drops one by Django's expected name would need the real name (same caveat as E1a/E2a). (Introduced v2.26.0, 2026-06-01; lawyer + gateway gate the real-money parts.)

- TD-076: **The Settings page (`/settings`) is a minimal stub.** `halatuju-web/src/app/settings/page.tsx` (73 lines) does only three things: a language selector, a "clear local data" button (`clearAll()` localStorage wipe), and an About block. **No account settings** — no profile/contact edit, no password change, no notification preferences, no logout, no delete-account. For a logged-in student the page offers nothing tied to their account. Also the **version string is hardcoded** (`const VERSION` — manually bumped at release; set to `2.26.1` on 2026-06-01 after it had gone stale at `2.0.0`) with no central runtime version source. **To resolve (when account self-service matters):** decide the real scope (likely: edit contact details, change password via Supabase, notification opt-outs, logout) and prototype in Stitch first per the UI discipline; and either wire `VERSION` to a build-injected `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` or accept the manual bump as a release-checklist line. Low priority — nothing depends on it. (Logged 2026-06-01)
- TD-077: **Course `#` interview marker renders as raw text, not a badge.** A trailing/embedded `#` in a course name means "this course typically has an interview", but it's shown verbatim (e.g. `Diploma in Nursing #`) wherever course names render — looks like a typo to users. **To resolve:** strip the `#` from the display string and render a small "Interview" badge/indicator next to courses that carry it (needs a shared helper so every render site — eligibility results, course pickers, saved courses, admin — is consistent; new i18n label; prototype the badge in Stitch first). Was roadmap "Known Issues #5" with no TD number; promoted here so it's tracked. Low priority, cosmetic. (Logged 2026-06-01)
- TD-078: **Subject-name map duplicated across the FE/BE boundary (`subjects.ts` ↔ `academic_engine._SUBJECT_BM`).** The verification-verdict academic check (S2) compares the OCR'd results-slip subject names against the typed grades by *normalised Bahasa-Melayu name*, which needs a Python `key → BM name` map; it mirrors `halatuju-web/src/lib/subjects.ts` `SUBJECT_NAMES`. Two hand-maintained copies in different languages → drift risk (a new SPM subject added to `subjects.ts` won't be matched by the backend until `_SUBJECT_BM` is updated too). Mitigated by a code comment linking the two. **To resolve:** either (a) generate `_SUBJECT_BM` from `subjects.ts` at build time, (b) move the canonical subject table to a shared JSON both sides load, or (c) add a paired test asserting equal key membership (the cheapest guard — but the test would have to read the TS file). Low priority; the map is stable and additive. (Logged 2026-06-02, Verification-verdict S2)
- TD-079: **Resolution sync writes on GET + a deleted compulsory doc doesn't resurface its resolved ticket.** `resolution.sync_resolution_items` (S3) persists/auto-resolves `ResolutionItem` rows, and it's called from the **read** paths — `AdminApplicationDetailSerializer.get_resolution_items` and the student `ResolutionItemListView.get`. So an admin/student *GET* mutates rows (idempotent + `IntegrityError`-guarded, but a REST-purity smell). Separately, the **no-re-nag** rule means once a system ticket is resolved it is never re-created, so if a student deletes a now-compulsory document the gap returns on the officer's verdict but the *student's* queue does not re-surface the ticket. **To resolve (if it matters):** move `sync` to explicit state-change points only (upload + delete signals + a dedicated POST refresh) and drop it from the serializers; and/or allow re-opening by keying dedup on open-status + adding a re-open path. Both are deliberate S3 simplifications, not bugs — the officer always sees the true gap via the verdict. Low priority. (Logged 2026-06-02, Verification-verdict S3)
- TD-080: **⚠️ LIVE BUG — IC uploaded as PDF/video fails OCR and is mislabelled as a service outage, stranding real applicants at consent.** Google Vision `document_text_detection` with inline `content=` bytes (`vision.extract_mykad`) only decodes raster images (JPEG/PNG/GIF/BMP/WEBP/TIFF/…); a **PDF or video** returns `"Bad image data."`. Two compounding defects turn that into a dead end: **(1) No upload format restriction.** The FE file input (`halatuju-web/src/components/ScholarshipDocuments.tsx:81`) has no `accept` attribute, and the API (`DocumentListCreateView.post`, `halatuju_api/apps/scholarship/views.py:236`) validates **size + doc-count only**, never MIME/extension — so PDFs (CamScanner / "scan to PDF") and even phone videos are accepted and stored. **(2) Misclassification.** `_ic_identity_blockers` (`services.py:482-485`) buckets **any** `vision_error != 'empty image'` into `ic_service_down`, so `"Bad image data."` surfaces to the student as *"Our document-check service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."* (`en.json` `ic_service_down`). "Try again later" never clears it — the stored file is a PDF/video — so the student is permanently blocked at the final consent step and reasonably concludes the system is down. **Evidence (prod, 30 May–01 Jun):** of 17 `ic`/`parent_ic` uploads, **all 9 PDFs/MP4s → "Bad image data", all 8 JPG/PNG/JPEG → success**, interleaved in time (∴ NOT a Vision outage; `detect_vision_outage` correctly does not trip). **5 students blocked** because their *own* `ic` is a PDF/video: THEEPICAA (#4, PDF), JANANI (#5, PDF), Harish (#6, PDF), YESWINDRAN (#8, CamScanner PDF), Taanusiya (#10, **.mp4 video**). **Immediate ops remediation (no code):** message these 5 to re-upload their IC as a **clear JPG/PNG photo** (camera, not scan/video) — OCR re-runs on upload and unblocks them. **Scope note:** this is **IC-only.** Supporting docs (`results_slip`, `str`, `salary_slip`, `epf`, `offer_letter`, bills) get a *soft, non-blocking* name/address presence check (`views.py:271-273` "Soft, never blocks"); consent only checks their **presence**, so a **PDF supporting doc submits fine** and shows no error — those must keep accepting PDF. Only the student's own `ic` hard-gates on a successful OCR read. **To resolve (code, post-sprint, needs approval), in priority order:** (1) **Fix the message** (smallest, do first) — re-map decode-type Vision errors (`"Bad image data."`, `"could not fetch image"`, read-nothing) to `ic_unreadable` ("please re-upload a clearer photo of your IC"), reserving `ic_service_down` for genuine service failures (`detect_vision_outage` already distinguishes); this alone ends the false "system down" dead-end. (2) **Handle PDF for the IC rather than ban it** — scanning a MyKad to PDF (CamScanner) is normal (3 of the 5 stuck students did this); rasterise the PDF's first page to an image server-side before Vision (e.g. pdf2image/Pillow) **or** use Vision's async PDF OCR, so scanned-IC PDFs just work. (3) Reject only truly unreadable types (video, etc.) with a clear "a photo or scan of your IC" message, and add `accept="image/*,.pdf"` on the IC input as a hint. **NB: do NOT add a blanket image-only restriction — it would break the legitimate PDF supporting docs.** **Higher priority than typical debt — affecting live applicants now.** (Logged 2026-06-02; investigation only, no code changed)
  - **✅ RESOLVED (deployed 2026-06-02, 2 deploys):** (1) PDF intake — content-type-aware OCR reads digital PDFs via the text layer and rasterises scanned PDFs (page 1) for Vision; (2) upload format allowlist (images + PDF; video/junk rejected) + FE `accept`; (3) decode-error re-map (`"Bad image data."` → `ic_unreadable`, not `ic_service_down`); plus follow-ups: parent-IC re-run enabled, MyKad name extraction anchored on the parentage marker, and a name mismatch no longer hard-blocks consent when the NRIC matches. See CHANGELOG [Unreleased]. Residual OCR-quality items tracked in TD-081.
- TD-081: **OCR signal-capturing improvements.** The TD-080 fixes made documents *readable*; this tracks making the *reads* better.
  - **✅ RESOLVED for the Identity/IC document (Check-1 sprint, deployed 2026-06-02, `3d110a4`).** (a) marker-less names + (b) blurry-scan NRIC digit misreads are both covered by the **cost-gated Gemini IC second opinion** (`run_vision_for_document` → `_should_gemini_ic` → `_gemini_ic_second_opinion` reads the card **image** → `_merge_ic_reads`, behind `IC_GEMINI_FALLBACK_ENABLED`); the deterministic name-truncation + address card-label strip handle the cheap cases for free. (c) clearer NRIC/name-mismatch guidance is delivered by the S4 Action Centre **and** Cikgu Gopal's now-bidirectional name-mismatch coaching (offer re-upload OR fix the typed profile name, with a `/profile` link). Plan + retro: `docs/scholarship/check1-ic-hardening-plan.md`, `docs/retrospective-check1-identity.md`.
  - **✅ Live smoke PASSED (2026-06-02, user-run, prod):** two real low-confidence MyKads both cleared — **Theresa** (truncated `…A/P` surname, the name case) and **Yeswindran** (unclear/misread NRIC digit, the blurry-number case). The cost-gated Gemini IC second opinion recovered both. The Identity fact is fully validated end-to-end.
  - **✅ RESOLVED for the Academic/results-slip document (deployed 2026-06-02/03, `62339e9`+`177aed2`; + live-review fixes `4391f54`+`b370503`).** Fixed the "Entered 0 of 9" band-word bug (`academic_engine._split_band`), the clinical 3-check (`student_slip_check` → `ResultsSlipChecklist` Name/Subjects/Results + exam year), 3 specific Gopal verdicts; live-confirmed. **Live-review follow-up (2026-06-03):** image-based Gemini slip read fixes the A↔A+ row transposition; a letter↔band disagreement OR a ±-only (same base letter) difference degrades to `uncertain` ("Please check", amber) — never a confident wrong mismatch. **Academic OCR quirk fully closed** (OCR can't guarantee the '+'; the officer verifies by eye). Retros `docs/retrospective-check1-academic.md`, `docs/retrospective-check1-livefixes.md`.
  - **✅ RESOLVED for the Pathway/offer-letter document (deployed 2026-06-03, `3abe9a9`+`a0d997f`; + reconciliation rework `6a54699`).** Differentiated facts (Name+IC checks + Programme/Institution/Issuer/Date/Address data points; expanded Gemini schema covering all post-SPM offer types; `pathway_engine.student_offer_check` + `OfferLetterChecklist`), PLUS the **AI-raised final-pathway confirmation** (migration `0038`). Live-confirmed across all 5 sample types. **Live-review rework (2026-06-03):** the always-ask confirm became a **lenient offer-vs-declared matcher** (`offer_pathway_match`) — match/nothing-to-compare → verified (no nag), genuine clash → reframed confirm + soft Gopal nudge (`offer_pathway_mismatch`) + red checklist rows; the student's Yes realigns the record. Editable self-edit in Funding deferred to Phase 2. Retros `docs/retrospective-check1-pathway.md`, `docs/retrospective-check1-livefixes.md`.
  - **✅ Slip-read robustness improved (deployed 2026-06-04, `c416c2e`).** The deterministic SPM-slip parser now reads
    sideways/keystoned phone photos via gated de-rotation in `academic_engine._group_rows` (it previously fell back to
    Gemini on non-upright slips, which transposed grades). Four real slips frozen as fixtures. Retro
    `docs/retrospective-check1-livetesting-fixes.md`.
  - **✅ INCOME Check-1 (item 3: earner identity + relationship) — SHIPPED 2026-06-04 (`9fa5ffe`+`d151bf6`+`a8bcd75`,
    migration `0039` migrate-first).** Guided document wizard (Documents → Household income) → dynamic checklist;
    earner-relationship proof (father=patronymic / mother=Birth Certificate [new doc type] / guardian=letter); rewired
    `_verdict_income` (verified/recommend/review/gap; never-block informal→interview flag); 11 reason codes (4-link
    chain). `income_engine.py` + `lib/incomeWizard.ts` (mirrored). Retro `retrospective-check1-income.md`. **Residual:

    click-through (TD-070).** _Original plan below:_
  - **✅ INCOME Check-1 COMPLETE — multi-earner salary route + per-document verification + per-capita amount gate
    (SHIPPED + DEPLOYED 2026-06-05, `e197209`→`668676b`, migration `0040` migrate-first).** The salary route became a
    multi-select ("tick everyone who works"); every income IC/salary-slip/EPF/STR is read and cross-checked against the
    earner's own IC (relationship semantics, never the student); a cluster-aware Cikgu Gopal speaks once per member; the
    **per-capita amount gate** (I4 — sum earners' pay from docs ÷ household size vs `per_capita_ceiling`) closes the last
    residual; EPF monthly-contribution + utility-bill address/hardship soft signals; birth-certificate + guardianship
    checklists surfaced. Retro `retrospective-check1-income-multiearner.md`. **The I4 amount-reading + utility-hardship
    residuals above are now RESOLVED.** Remaining residual: the document-first verdict gap (TD-085) + the income-cockpit
    redesign, and the live click-through (TD-070).

    slip-orientation 2026-06-04.)
- TD-082: **Student Action Centre `confirm` tickets for academic route to the Documents tab, not a grades-edit surface.** `/application` has no dedicated grades/results tab (grades come from the profile/onboarding; the results slip is uploaded under Documents), so a `confirm` ticket with `fact==='academic'` (e.g. `academic_missing_subjects` — "add Moral + Tamil Literature") sends the student to **Documents** rather than to the place they actually add subjects (the onboarding grades flow). Acceptable for now — the ticket copy states what to do and the ticket auto-clears once the subjects are entered — but the "Review" button under-delivers for academic. **To resolve:** add an in-`/application` grades-edit affordance (or deep-link the onboarding grades step) and map academic `confirm` to it (`actionCentre.confirmTargetFor` + `ScholarshipNextSteps.handleConfirmNav`). Low priority. (Logged 2026-06-02, Verification-verdict S4)
  - **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-07:** `confirmTargetFor` now routes academic facts to a new `'grades'` target (the results
    *slip* stays on Documents); `handleConfirmNav` deep-links `'grades'` to `/onboarding/grades` with a return marker
    (`setOnboardingReturn('/scholarship/application')` → `popOnboardingReturn` honoured by the onboarding final step).
    Grades rehydrate from the profile via auth-context, so the editor isn't blank for a returning student.
- TD-083: **Verdict override-rate metric + `officer_verdict.overall` are built on the backend but not surfaced in the cockpit UI.** S5 ships `GET /api/v1/admin/scholarship/verdict-metrics/` (pure `audit.override_metrics` → `{applications, fact_decisions, overrides, override_rate, per_fact}`) and the `getVerdictMetrics()`/`VerdictMetrics` FE type, but the cockpit does **not** render the "how good is the AI" override rate anywhere — it's queryable, not visible. Separately, the officer records a per-fact pass/fail in the Record-verdict panel, but the `officer_verdict.overall` ('accept'|'decline'|'hold') field has **no explicit UI toggle** (it's sent as `''`; the backend accepts that and the overall stance can be inferred from the four facts). **To resolve (when a coordinator dashboard is wanted):** add a small "AI override rate" line/card to the admin console (cohort-filterable via `?cohort=`), and either add an explicit overall accept/decline control to the panel or wire it to the existing verify-&-accept / decline actions so `overall` is set deliberately. Low priority — the audit data is captured regardless; this is surfacing + an optional explicit control. (Logged 2026-06-02, Verification-verdict S5)
  **Resolved (surfacing) — verification-assurance Sprint 3, 2026-06-12.** The override rate is now visible: an **AI reliability card** at the top of the B40 applications list shows agreement (= 1 − override rate) per fact + overall, via the tested `verdictReliability()` helper over the existing `getVerdictMetrics()`. The `?cohort=` filter remains available on the endpoint but the card shows the all-cohort figure. The **second half — an explicit `officer_verdict.overall` accept/decline/hold UI toggle — was deliberately NOT built**: the card derives reliability from the four per-fact Pass/Fail decisions the reviewer already makes, so `overall` stays inferred (sent as `''`). If a future coordinator dashboard wants an explicit overall stance, re-open a thin follow-up for just that toggle.
- TD-084: **Orphaned single-earner income fields after the salary route went multi-earner.** The salary income route now uses `ScholarshipApplication.income_working_members` (multi-select); `earner_work_status` (old Q3) and `household_other_earners` (old Q4) are no longer read on that route (the STR route never used them) — kept in place to avoid a destructive migration. Likewise the wizard i18n keys `scholarship.docs.income.wizard.{q2,q3,q4,work}` are now unreferenced (kept for parity across en/ms/ta). **To resolve:** drop the two columns under expand-contract (grep for readers first — already write-only) and delete the four i18n key groups in all three locales. Low priority, cosmetic. (Logged 2026-06-04, Income Check-1 multi-earner)
- TD-085: **▶ RE-SCOPED 2026-06-05 to TWO sprints (consent gate v2 + officer Documents-panel redesign). The original
  "document-first verdict" + "re-extraction backfill" framing below was DROPPED:** the route stays AUTHORITATIVE (the
  strict route-aware gate + the manual slotting of all 16 pipeline students prevent the route/doc mismatch document-first
  was meant to fix), and the user re-runs legacy docs by hand in the cockpit. Spec: `docs/scholarship/consent-gate-v2-plan.md`.
  - **✅ S1 (consent gate v2) SHIPPED 2026-06-05 (no migration; retro `retrospective-consent-gate-v2-s1.md`):** the
    consent/submission gate is route-aware + strict (offer letter compulsory for all; per-route income docs; EPF no
    longer substitutes a salary slip), sourced from `income_engine.income_requirements` via `services.income_doc_blockers`;
    "never-block" moved to the interview verdict only; the 6 already-submitted apps grandfathered (keyed on
    `profile_completed_at`). 697 scholarship + 1037 courses pytest + 250 jest + i18n 1985.
  - **✅ S2 (officer Documents-panel redesign) SHIPPED 2026-06-05 (no migration; retro `retrospective-td085-cockpit-s2.md`) — ▶▶ TD-085 RESOLVED.**
    Coloured per-doc fact-labels (`officerCockpit.documentFacts`); movable relationship (father/sibling IC patronymic /

    "Unread" bug. `AdminApplicationDetailSerializer` now surfaces the income wizard answers (3 fields, no migration).
    258 jest + next build clean + i18n 2013. **TD-085 is complete** (consent gate v2 + cockpit redesign; the
    document-first verdict + re-extraction backfill were intentionally dropped — the route stays authoritative).
    Residual (own backlog items, not TD-085): the PARKED post-consent summary page + lock-at-Continue,
    ~~Gopal income copy~~ **(✅ done 2026-06-06 — one cluster Gopal per earner + lean diagnose→advise tone, `4fb5255`/
    `6d40af2`; retro `retrospective-gopal-cockpit-polish.md`)**, and re-running legacy docs by hand (the user's manual
    cockpit "Re-run").
  - _Original (dropped) framing for the record:_ Income verdict is wizard-route-driven, not document-driven — it ignores income proof the route didn't expect, and pre-wizard submissions can't assemble. Two linked gaps surfaced live (app #21, KISHANTAN): (a) the **STR-route branch of `verdict_engine._verdict_income` only accepts an `str` document as income proof** — a student flagged `receives_str=true` (so the wizard defaulted `income_route='str'`) who uploads the father's salary slip instead of an STR screenshot gets a red *"no proof of income"* even though the payslip + father's IC are present and the earner relationship is confirmed. The salary slip sitting in the drawer is never considered. (b) **Pre-wizard submissions have no route/earner/tags** — a pipeline audit found **15 apps with `income_route=''`** (the wizard didn't exist when they submitted), of which **only 6 are actually submitted (`profile_complete`)** and **9 are merely `shortlisted`** (not yet submitted — they self-heal when they walk the wizard to complete). So the real legacy remediation is **~7 submitted apps** (the 6 blank-route + app #21), not 15. Their income docs are in the **correct doc_types** (slotting is fine) but `household_member=''` (untagged), so the new salary-route cluster keying can't group them. **To resolve:** (1) make the income verdict **document-first** — look at what income proof actually exists (STR / salary slip / EPF, tagged or not) and verify it against the available parent IC(s), using the wizard answers (route/earner/members) as *hints not hard gates*; an STR-route student with a salary slip should still get per-capita credit; (2) a one-time **backfill** of `income_route`/`income_earner` for the 6 blank-route submitted apps so their clusters assemble; (3) **reconfigure the income cockpit** so the tile reflects what is actually in the drawer (surface the salary slip + per-capita + cluster) and never claims *"no proof of income"* when a verified income doc is present. The 9 shortlisted apps need nothing. (Logged 2026-06-05, Income Check-1 multi-earner close — the user's explicit next sprint.)
- TD-086: **Reminder support email is a personal Gmail (`tamiliam@gmail.com`).** The completion-reminder + closure emails
  point students to `emails.SUPPORT_EMAIL = 'tamiliam@gmail.com'` as the human fallback — intentional "for now" (user's
  call) so the system could go live. **To resolve:** swap to a branded address (e.g. `help@halatuju.xyz`, or a Gmail
  alias/forward) — a one-line change to `SUPPORT_EMAIL` in `apps/scholarship/emails.py`. Low priority, cosmetic/privacy.
  (Logged 2026-06-06, application-reminders.)
- TD-087: **Completion reminders land ~1 day after their nominal day-count.** The cadence uses
  `floor((now - reminder_anchor_at).days)` against thresholds (2/9/23/53), but the daily scheduler ticks at a FIXED 09:00
  Asia/KL while `reminder_anchor_at` carries the clock-time it was set — when the tick falls a few minutes before the
  anchor's time-of-day, the day threshold is first met one tick later (e.g. a 4-Jun anchor's R2 fires 14 Jun, not 13).
  Harmless for a reminder (consistent 1-day slip). **To resolve (if day-exact timing ever matters):** anchor to a DATE
  (midnight) or compare on date boundaries rather than a floor-of-timedelta. Low priority. (Logged 2026-06-06.)
  - **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-07** (`services._elapsed_days_local`): the cadence now compares calendar dates in Asia/KL
    instead of flooring the timedelta, so each reminder fires on its nominal day regardless of the anchor's time-of-day.
    +2 regression tests in `test_reminders.py`. Auto-close gate left as-is (it compares two 09:00-job stamps → no slip).
- TD-088: **Two local `formatNric` duplicates in the admin students pages.** `app/admin/students/page.tsx` and
  `app/admin/students/[id]/page.tsx` each define their own `formatNric(nric: string | null)` (null-safe, returns the raw
  string when not 12 digits) instead of importing the shared `lib/scholarship.ts` one. Left unconsolidated in the
  income-card sprint deliberately: the shared helper takes `string` (not `string | null`) and returns `''` (not `'—'`)
  for invalid input, so a blind swap would crash on a null `nric`. **To resolve:** make the shared `formatNric` null-safe
  (or add a `formatNricDisplay` wrapper) and replace both locals. Cosmetic; both already render the canonical format.
  Low priority. (Logged 2026-06-06.)
  - **✅ RESOLVED** (this [Unreleased] cycle; see CHANGELOG "Changed"): added a null‑safe `formatNricDisplay()` in
    `lib/scholarship.ts` (em‑dash for a missing IC); both admin pages and the new `ScholarshipReview` use it.
- TD-089: **The guardianship-letter relationship path is unwired (guardian income route).** Unlike the birth
  certificate (fixed 2026-06-06), `guardianship_letter` is NOT in `views.SUPPORTING_NAME_CHECK_TYPES`, so an uploaded
  letter is never OCR'd or field-extracted. Worse, `income_engine._relationship_inputs` reads the letter's name from
  `doc.vision_name` — a field only the IC path (`run_vision_for_document`) sets; neither `run_vision_match_for_document`
  nor `run_field_extraction_for_document` writes it. So even after routing the letter into the pipeline, the guardian
  relationship would stay `pending`. **To resolve:** add `guardianship_letter` to `SUPPORTING_NAME_CHECK_TYPES` +
  `RELATIONSHIP_DOC_TYPES`, give it a name field in its extraction schema, and change `_relationship_inputs` to read the
  guardian's name from `vision_fields['fields']` (not `vision_name`). Deliberately NOT done in the BC fix to avoid making
  valid guardian letters show a false "unreadable". Guardian income route is rare; low priority. (Logged 2026-06-06.)
- TD-090: **`handleConfirm` does a full `window.location.reload()` after submit** (`ScholarshipNextSteps.tsx`) to
  re-render the page as the post-submit "received" screen, instead of updating React state in place. Pragmatic and
  reliable (the received screen lives in the parent `application/page.tsx`, keyed off `app.status`, so a reload is the
  simplest way to flip to it), but it's a heavier transition than necessary and loses client state. **To resolve:** lift
  the submitted application up via the existing `onChange`/refresh path so the parent re-renders without a full reload.
  Cosmetic; low priority. (Logged 2026-06-07, Review & submit flow.)
  - **✅ RESOLVED 2026-06-07** (same day): `ScholarshipNextSteps` gained an `onSubmitted` prop; `handleConfirm` hands the
    updated application to the parent (`onSubmitted={setApp}`), which re-renders into the post-submit "received" screen —
    no `window.location.reload()`.
- TD-091: **Sponsor-landing Tamil copy is a best-effort first pass, not the owner's voice.** The `sponsorLanding.*`
  Tamil strings (en/ms/ta parity, 40 keys) were written to ship trilingual but need the owner's refinement per the
  Tamil style guide (joins the existing Tamil-refine queue). Low risk — the page is dark behind `SPONSOR_POOL_ENABLED`
  until go-live. **To resolve:** owner refine pass on `messages/ta.json` `sponsorLanding` before Sprint 12 go-live.

- TD-092: **Sponsor landing not yet click-through-verified in a live browser.** Sprint 1 verified F1 via `next build`
  typecheck + jest + the approved Stitch design, but did not run a Playwright/dev-server click-through (the page is dark
  on prod, and a live smoke needs `SPONSOR_POOL_ENABLED=on` locally with both servers). **To resolve:** before the
  Sprint 12 go-live deploy, run the app locally with the flag on and click through `/sponsor` in all three locales +
  confirm the counter renders the real eligible count. (Logged 2026-06-08, B40 Phase E/F Sprint 1.)
- ✅ RESOLVED (go-live 2026-06-09) — TD-093: **The new `onboarding_responses` table (migration `0049`) needs RLS enabled on Supabase at deploy.** New
  Django-created tables land without row-level security; per the existing new-model pattern (TD-058 era), enable RLS +
  the appropriate policy when applying `0049` migrate-first via the Supabase MCP, and re-run `get_advisors` to confirm
  no "RLS disabled" finding. Low risk while dark (the api connects with a privileged role), but must be closed before
  go-live. **To resolve:** at the Phase E/F batch deploy, after `0049`, enable RLS on `onboarding_responses`. (Logged

  `send_sponsor_digests` (WEEKLY) are registered in `CronRunView.JOBS` (`sponsor-realtime`, `sponsor-digests`) but have
  no scheduler entries yet. **To resolve:** at the Phase E/F batch deploy, create two Cloud Scheduler jobs hitting the
  cron endpoint with `X-Cron-Secret` (mirror `halatuju-application-reminders`): hourly for `sponsor-realtime`, weekly
  for `sponsor-digests` (Asia/KL). Harmless while dark — no sponsor is `realtime`/`weekly`-eligible until the pool flag
  is on and sponsors exist. (Logged 2026-06-09, B40 Phase E/F Sprint 4.)
- TD-096: **Sponsor notification emails default to English.** `Sponsor` has no locale field, so F3 emails send in
  English (the `send_sponsor_*` templates are trilingual and ready). **To resolve:** add a `locale` to `Sponsor`
  (captured at registration) and pass it through `sponsor_notifications`. Low priority. (Logged 2026-06-09, B40 Phase
  E/F Sprint 4.)
- TD-097: **The F6 reviewer-credentials Tamil copy is a first-draft.** `admin.reviewer.*` Tamil strings were written
  to ship trilingual but need the owner's refinement (joins the Tamil-refine queue with TD-091/094). English + Malay
  are final. Low risk — the page is staff-only and held local until the batch deploy. **To resolve:** owner Tamil
  refine before Sprint 12 go-live. (Logged 2026-06-09, B40 Phase E/F Sprint 5.)

  `reviewer_profiles` table is created by a new-model migration; per the TD-058 pattern, prod has no
  contenttypes/auth tables, so a plain `manage.py migrate` exits non-zero on the `post_migrate` signal even when the
  DDL commits. **To resolve:** at the Phase E/F batch deploy, apply `0051` via the Supabase MCP (CREATE TABLE +
  record the `django_migrations` row), then **enable RLS on `reviewer_profiles`** (deny-by-default, service-role-only
  — it holds sensitive staff PII: phone/address) and re-run `get_advisors`. Must be closed before go-live. (Logged

- TD-101: **The F2 "My students" view is read-only — donate/withdraw not wired.** The account header shows the giving
  balance but no functional "Donate more"; an offered (pending) card shows "Awaiting acceptance" but no "Withdraw
  offer" action, though `SponsorDonateView` (mock) and `SponsorCancelOfferView` both exist. These are E3 wallet actions
  (the real money is TD-075); F2 deliberately ships the *profile + list* read-surface only. **To resolve:** wire
  `donate`/`cancel` into the My-students view when the E3 wallet UI is built (or sooner if a dark click-through needs

  `0051`, the new `assignment_events` table is a new-model migration; prod has no contenttypes/auth tables, so a plain
  `manage.py migrate` exits non-zero on `post_migrate` even when the DDL commits. **To resolve:** at the Phase E/F batch
  deploy, apply `0052` via the Supabase MCP (ADD COLUMN `assigned_at` + CREATE TABLE `assignment_events` + record the

  a reviewer with the right role, but the roadmap's secondary "prompt Reviewer profile (F6) completion on first
  sign-in" was deferred to keep the sprint small — a newly-invited reviewer can reach `/admin` with a blank
  `ReviewerProfile`. **To resolve:** on the admin dashboard (or `/admin/profile`), show a dismissable banner for a

  the `django_migrations` row), then **enable RLS on both** (deny-by-default, service-role-only — `graduation_messages`

  (`purge_sponsor_referrals`) is whitelisted in `CronRunView.JOBS` but needs a **daily** Cloud Scheduler HTTP job
  (mirroring the F3 `sponsor-realtime`/`sponsor-digests` jobs: region, `X-Cron-Secret` from `CRON_SECRET`,

  `REFERRAL_INVITE_*` Tamil email templates were written to keep parity but need the owner's review per
  `tamil-style-guide.md` (the invite email is sent to a real prospective sponsor). Fold into the pre-go-live Tamil refine

- TD-104: **F9b's results form has no slip-upload control (CGPA-only).** The approved Stitch design showed an optional
  "Upload results slip (staff-only)" row, but the document upload pipeline (sign-upload → PUT → create doc) is heavy and
  the CGPA/`graduated` values are what drive the sponsor-facing progress band; the `results_slip` FK on the backend is
  left unset from this surface. **To resolve (optional):** wire the existing document-upload flow into the Add-result
  form (or let the student attach via a future in-programme Documents tab) and pass `results_slip` to
  `addSemesterResult`. Low priority — the band works without it. (Logged 2026-06-09, B40 Phase E/F Sprint 10.)

  Tamil strings (48 keys) were written to keep en/ms/ta parity but need the owner's review per `tamil-style-guide.md` —

- TD-103: **Semester-result CGPA is student-entered, not OCR-derived.** F9a's `record_semester_result` accepts an
  optional `results_slip` (a myNADI-only `ApplicantDocument`) but does NOT auto-extract the CGPA from it — the student
  types the CGPA + semester. The roadmap envisaged "reuse the OCR path"; deferred because the in-programme university
  slip differs from the SPM `results_slip` the academic engine parses, and a manual CGPA is enough to drive the coarse
  progress band. **To resolve (optional):** when an in-programme slip OCR schema exists, pre-fill the CGPA from the slip
  and let the student confirm (don't auto-trust). Low priority; the band only needs a coarse value. (Logged 2026-06-09,
  B40 Phase E/F Sprint 9.)
- TD-109: **`source='system'` resolution items are created but no longer shown to students.** The Action Centre now
  excludes `source='system'` from the student queue (`ResolutionItemListView`), and the officer cockpit reads the
  verdict directly (not `resolution_items`) — so `sync_resolution_items`' system rows are effectively dead (created +
  auto-resolved, read by nothing student-facing). Harmless but wasteful (a write on every GET — see TD-079). **To
  resolve (optional):** either stop generating `source='system'` items, or keep them only if a future feature reads
  them; revisit together with TD-079 (resolution sync writes on GET). Low priority. (Logged 2026-06-10, Action Centre.)
- TD-110: **`resolution.doc_match_verdict` duplicates the per-doc red/unreadable logic in
  `services.document_red_blockers` / `document_unreadable_blockers`.** Both classify each doc_type's `*_check` into
  mismatch/unreadable using the same status sets, so they must be kept in lockstep (the Action Centre and the consent
  gate must agree on a document). **To resolve:** extract one shared per-doc helper (e.g. `income_engine`/a new
  `doc_verdicts` module) that both call, when either is next touched. Low priority (a paired comment + the cross-check
  is the current mitigation). (Logged 2026-06-10, Action Centre.) **Update 2026-06-12:** `doc_match_verdict` now also
  returns a `'pending'` (not-yet-scanned → hold the task) state that the consent-gate blockers don't have — by design
  (the pre-submit gate's wizard is still open), but a future shared helper must keep the `'pending'` branch on the
  Action-Centre side only.
- TD-111: **Check-2 student-query coverage — the anomaly engine detects more than the clarify generator can ask, so
  student-answerable issues are silently dropped.** Check-2's student clarify questions come from a FIXED 4-item list
  (`check2_queries.CLARIFY_SPECS`: course/sibling/device/transport) tied to STEP-1 completeness gaps; the
  `anomaly_engine` detects more (`funding_other_without_note`, `device_in_funding`, …) but those stay OFFICER-only
  pre-interview flags and are never bridged into the student clarify stream — and there's NO detector for "utility
  account-holder ≠ student/parent". Surfaced on Theepicaa (app #4): Check-2 raised the BC (verdict ticket) + sibling
  level (clarify) but MISSED the funding-"other"-with-no-note and the water-bill-in-a-third-name questions. **To
  resolve:** (1) route EVERY detected issue (STEP-1 gaps + anomaly flags) through one triage tagging each ask-student /
  officer-only / auto-answered, so anomaly flags that are one-line + non-sensitive become clarify queries; (2) add the
  utility-account-holder-mismatch detector; (3) add a **coverage critic** that asserts every detected issue is routed
  somewhere and logs any "detected-but-routed-nowhere" (the durable safety net vs hand-adding specs); keep MAX_CLARIFY=3
  + prioritise (BC before funding note). Exclude the empty-`justification` field (owner: not a good question). FE/BE, no
  migration; student stream still flag-gated (CHECK2_STUDENT_QUERIES_ENABLED) so it surfaces to the officer until on.
  (Logged 2026-06-10, Action Centre follow-up.)
- TD-112: **Income route-switch not yet click-tested in a browser.** The post-submit self-serve income route switch
  (endpoint `.../income-route/` + `IncomeRouteSwitch` mini-wizard) is integration-tested via Django's test client (11
  tests: both directions, recompute, no-re-block) and the FE type-checks, but the live in-browser flow on a real
  `profile_complete` student isn't click-tested. Verify on prod after deploy: open the Action Centre on an STR-route
  student with an income task → "Change how you prove your income" → switch to salary → confirm → the STR task clears,
  the earner-IC task appears, status stays `profile_complete`. (Logged 2026-06-12, income route switch. TD-070 pattern.)
- TD-113: **Switching to the salary route does not ticket the salary slip (soft signal only).** The salary verdict
  (`verdict_engine._verdict_income_salary`) raises ticketable gaps for the earner IC + relationship docs, but a missing
  salary slip keeps income at `recommend`/`income_unverified_needs_interview` (an officer/interview flag, never a student
  task) — by design (the salary route never hard-blocks post-submit). So a student who switches STR→salary is prompted
  for the IC but not, via an Action-Centre task, for the salary slip; the route-switch wizard's "we'll show you which
  documents to upload" + the income_requirements checklist set the expectation. **To resolve (if wanted):** add a
  `salary_slip_missing` ticketable verdict code on the salary route + entry in `CODE_TO_TICKET`. **Needs sign-off** — it
  reopens the "never hard-block post-submit income" decision (consent-gate-v2). (Logged 2026-06-12, income route switch.)
- TD-114: **A fact can read CERTAIN off documents whose genuineness was never checked — a folder of typed sheets
  passed as Pathway + Income CERTAIN (test #16).** CERTAIN is asserted on field-match alone (typed text matches the
  application); it does not require the *document* to be genuine. Two holes: (A) genuineness runs at upload only and
  is never backfilled, so pre-feature uploads sit unscored and the verdict treats unscored as fine; (B) structural —
  `offer_letter`/`salary_slip` are un-fingerprinted (so Pathway can never be capped), and the engine never gates
  CERTAIN on a passed genuineness check. Demo (2026-06-13): re-running genuineness on #16's income docs dropped Income
  CERTAIN→Probable, but Pathway stayed CERTAIN (offer letter uncovered). **Approved design + full scope: `docs/scholarship/
  verification-genuineness-gating-plan.md`** (gate CERTAIN on genuineness; confirmed fake → Unsure; cover the offer
  letter; backfill command). **DEFERRED — edge case for our population; lower priority than current fixes.** Owner
  go-ahead required before building. (Logged 2026-06-13, test #16 finding.)
- TD-115: **No fixed document-slot model — uploads share slots and the income engine stores docs by a
  route-dependent convention, causing the "one IC under all earners" + "duplicate Mother's IC" bugs.** Target: 27 fixed
  `(doc_type × person)` slots; every upload (wizard or Action Centre) tagged by person; re-upload overwrites the slot;
  route controls which slots are required vs optional (not storage). Blocker: `income_engine._cluster_docs` reads STR-route
  docs as blank-member and salary-route docs as tagged — so data can't be re-tagged ahead of the code (one coordinated
  code + migration). Prod assessed safe: deterministic for ~all docs; only 1 true route correction (#12 salary→STR);
  duplicates hand-cleaned (#16, #12). **Full spec + confirmed model: `docs/scholarship/document-slot-model-plan.md`.**
  **Sprint 1 SHIPPED 2026-06-13** (`main` `7b460d4` + MCP backfill; retro `docs/retrospective-slot-model-s1.md`): tolerant
  readers (by-person, blank-as-earner fallback on STR) + authoritative upload tagging (STR income docs ← `income_earner`,
  tolerant sweep) + wizard per-earner; 53 docs backfilled (0 blanks, 0 dup slots); #12 corrected → STR/mother. Verdict-invariant.
  **(b) RESOLVED 2026-06-14** — salary-route Action-Centre member-tagging: an officer per-person doc request stashes the
  member in the ticket's `params`; the student's Action-Centre upload tags `household_member` from there (Check-2/Check-3 S2b,
  `main`). **(c) RESOLVED 2026-06-14** — Check-2/Check-3 process flow & display shipped as the cockpit redesign (4 sprints +
  3 review rounds; `f5243a7` → `762b358`; roadmap `docs/scholarship/check2-check3-roadmap.md`).
  **Still open (deferred):** (a) DB `UniqueConstraint(application,doc_type,household_member)` — the permanent guarantee; needs
  test-fixture rework (tests pre-create same-slot docs) + migrate-first; app layer already prevents dups. (Logged 2026-06-13; b+c closed 2026-06-14.)
- TD-116: **EPF mining benefits NEW uploads only — existing EPF statements need a re-parse to populate the new fields.**
  The 2026-06-14 EPF work (`97a7793`) extracts `avg_monthly_contribution`/`months_counted`/`contribution_status`/
  `statement_date`/`address`, but these need the CARUMAN rows + statement body, which aren't in the already-stored
  extracted fields — only a re-OCR/Gemini re-run repopulates them (billable). Shipped with a graceful fallback (the
  income estimate uses the latest-month figure for old records, so no regression). **To resolve (when wanted):** a
  targeted per-doc "Re-run vision" on the EPFs that matter, or a small `--apply` command that re-extracts EPFs (billable
  — owner's call). Low priority; outcomes already correct via the fallback. (Logged 2026-06-14.)
- TD-117: **#37-class mis-slot (an STR screenshot uploaded as EPF) isn't flagged on OLD docs because the wrong-type
  genuineness check never ran on them.** #37's EPF doc (id 411) predates the genuineness + capture layers
  (`authenticity: null`, `capture: null`); Gemini pulled a name+NRIC but no EPF financials, and `vision.doc_genuineness`
  → `wrong_type` (the designed detector) never ran, so no officer flag. A per-doc Re-run flags it. **Optional backstop
  (offered, not built):** a deterministic "EPF extracted a name but NO balance/contribution/year/employer → doesn't look
  like an EPF" soft officer signal (no billable call), to catch mis-slots even when genuineness hasn't run. (Logged
  2026-06-14.)
- **TD-118 (low) ✅ RESOLVED (small-change lane, 2026-06-16):** removed the six dead api-client functions
  (`generateSponsorProfile`, `finaliseSponsorProfile`, `saveSponsorProfile`, `publishSponsorProfile`,
  `generateAnonProfile`, `publishAnonProfile`) from `admin-api.ts` (the `AdminSponsorProfile` type is retained — still
  used by `sponsor_profile` + the cockpit), and the 29 orphaned i18n leaves under `admin.scholarship`
  (`generate`/`generating`/`regenerate`/`save`/`saving`/`publish`/`publishing`/`genError`/`saveError`/`publishError`
  + the whole `finalProfile.*` and `anonProfile.*` objects) across en/ms/ta — parity held at 2653×3. Each was grep-verified
  to have zero references (no dynamic key-building). `tsc` introduced no new error. Kept the still-rendered profile keys
  (`profileTitle`/`profileDraftHint`/`profilePending`/`genLang`/`model`). See TD-120 for a wider orphan set found in passing.
- **TD-118 (original): tidy dead profile UI plumbing after the narrative redesign.** The 2026-06-15 profile redesign
  removed the manual Generate/Save/Publish/Refine controls + the anonymous-profile card from the cockpit, but left
  behind: (a) unused api client functions in `halatuju-web/src/lib/admin-api.ts` (`generateSponsorProfile`,
  `finaliseSponsorProfile`, `saveSponsorProfile`, `publishSponsorProfile`, `generateAnonProfile`, `publishAnonProfile`)
  and (b) now-orphaned i18n keys under `admin.scholarship` (`generate`/`regenerate`/`save`/`publish` + `anonProfile.*` +
  some `finalProfile.*`). All harmless (build green, i18n parity intact), so deferred from the redesign sprint. Remove
  them in a future web-only change, grepping each key/fn for references first and keeping en/ms/ta parity. (Logged
  2026-06-15.)
- TD-119: **13 corpus false-positive flags still undiagnosed** — the eval run flagged 5 `parent_ic`, 5
  `birth_certificate`, 1 `epf`, 1 `str`, 1 `offer_letter` (mismatch), 1 `offer_letter` (unreadable) as genuine-docs-
  wrongly-flagged. The owner reviewed `ic`/`parent_ic` as all-genuine, so these are likely matcher false positives of
  the same class as the results-slip ones. **To resolve:** run the diagnose → fix → test loop per type (the
  results-slip pass closed 11 of the original 24). (Logged 2026-06-16, Genuineness signatures.)
- **TD-120 (low) ✅ RESOLVED (small-change lane, 2026-06-16):** removed **77** orphaned `admin.scholarship` i18n leaves
  across en/ms/ta (parity 2654→2577×3), pruned four now-empty objects (`extractFields`, `interview.rubric`,
  `recordVerdict.tools`, `upu`). Used a **dynamic-aware scan** (full-path literals + concatenation/template prefixes) so
  the dynamically-addressed subtrees (`anomaly.*`, `verdict.item.*`, `docsDrawer.*`, `statuses.*`, etc.) were correctly
  kept; cross-verified every candidate by grep, and confirmed the translator has no scoped/prefixed variant (every key is
  a full path). Chief removals: the retired **Verify & accept** card, the old **Vision OCR** card labels, and assorted
  dead field labels (`coq`, `referralSource`, `guardianName`, `pathway`, `upu.*`, `caveats.*` leftovers, …). Added a
  **guardrail** — `halatuju-web/src/messages/__tests__/admin-scholarship-i18n.test.ts` (jest) — that fails on any future
  orphan or en/ms/ta drift in this namespace, so the set can't silently regrow. jest 322 green; tsc clean; web-only, no
  migration. **Original entry (for context):**
- **TD-120 (original): a wider set of orphaned `admin.scholarship` i18n keys, beyond the profile redesign.** While doing
  TD-118 I scanned every leaf under `admin.scholarship` and found ~80 more keys with no code reference — chiefly the
  retired **Verify & accept** card (`verifyTitle`, `verifyHint`, `verifyAccept`, `nricLocked`, `acceptNeedsVerdict`,
  `check_nric`/`check_name`/`check_results`/`check_document`), and assorted field labels (`coq`, `referralSource`,
  `guardianName`, `intendsTertiary`, `declarationName`, `anythingElse`, several `interview.*`/`caveats.*`/`upu.*`/
  `docsDrawer.capture.*` leaves, etc.). These accumulated across earlier cockpit redesigns (the verify step folded into
  "Save verdict IS the decision"), NOT this round, so they were out of TD-118's scope and deliberately left to avoid
  scope-creeping a small change. **To resolve:** a dedicated web-only pass that re-runs the leaf scan, hand-verifies each
  candidate against dynamic key-building (many siblings ARE built dynamically — `statuses.*`, `anomaly.*`, `verdict.item.*`,
  `docsDrawer.*` — so a naive bulk delete would break the UI), removes only the confirmed-dead, and keeps en/ms/ta parity.
  Worth pairing with a guardrail (an i18n orphan-key check) so the set stops regrowing. (Logged 2026-06-16. NB: the
  unmerged `feature/doc-eval-harness` branch reserves TD-119 for its own corpus-flag debt — hence this is TD-120.)
- TD-121: **The eval harness scorecard doesn't run counter-examples through the genuineness cap.**
  `eval_doc_recognition --auto-ok` scores via `resolution.doc_match_verdict` (content match), which never reads
  `vision_fields['authenticity']` — that cap lives in `verdict_engine.build_verdict`. So the known typed fake (a16)
  shows as a content false-negative even though the new signature scorer + cap would flag it `suspect` in production.
  **To resolve:** capture the signature genuineness into the cached snapshots and score counter-examples through the
  band (or through `build_verdict`), so the two-directional scorecard reflects the genuineness layer. Verified inline
  during the sprint (a16 → suspect; 43 genuine → genuine; 4 cropped → review; zero misclassifications), just not wired
  into the command. (Logged 2026-06-16, Genuineness signatures.)
- TD-122 **✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-20):** BC + EPF genuineness now come from the probabilistic SIGNATURE
  scorer in the live upload path (`vision.run_field_extraction_for_document` routes `birth_certificate`
  + `epf` through `signature_genuineness`; STR stays holistic). Text-dominant (visual markers are bonus,
  the text clears the band); the EPF scorer doubles as the wrong-type backstop (tax/withdrawal/STR →
  not_epf, TD-117). Flag-gated, no migration; +wiring tests. (Logged 2026-06-16; done 2026-06-20.)
- TD-123 **✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-20):** Issue-2 extraction updated for BC + EPF. BC: dropped `bc_number`
  (schema + Gemini hint; `bc_child_nric` already optional/barcode-bound). EPF: extract the **employer-
  and employee-share contribution TOTALS separately** + `months_counted` + `employer_number`; the income
  engine derives `monthly_salary = max(ΣMajikan/(n·0.13), ΣAhli/(n·0.11))` (`income_engine._epf_monthly_salary`;
  `employer_number == 000000000 ⇒ unemployed → 0`), with a **legacy fallback** (combined contribution ÷ 0.24)
  so already-extracted prod EPFs don't regress. Retired `avg_monthly_contribution` from extraction. +tests.
  *(Minor follow-up: the deterministic `doc_parse` EPF parser doesn't yet emit the split totals → those
  records use the legacy-fallback estimate; image-Gemini EPFs use the precise max() formula.)* (Logged 2026-06-16; done 2026-06-20.)
- TD-124: **Contact-form messages are email-only — no in-app inbox.** `/contact` → `contact_submissions`; the
  `notify-contact-submissions` cron (2026-06-18) emails each unread row to `contact@halatuju.xyz` and marks it read.
  There is no `/admin/messages` UI to browse/triage them. **To resolve:** a small admin inbox reading
  `contact_submissions` with the `read` toggle. Low priority (email covers the need at current volume). (Logged 2026-06-18.)
- TD-125: **The Meet service-account JSON key lives in a Cloud Run env var (`GOOGLE_MEET_SA_JSON`), not Secret
  Manager.** Matches the project's existing env-var secret pattern (CRON_SECRET, GEMINI_API_KEY) but a long-lived SA
  key is higher-value. **To resolve:** move to Secret Manager (mounted) or switch `meeting.py` to keyless DWD via the
  Cloud Run runtime SA (workload identity), removing the key entirely. (Logged 2026-06-18.)
- TD-126: **Interview-scheduling Guide step has no screenshot.** The Guide "Scheduling the interview" step renders
  text-only (images were made optional). **To resolve:** once `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULING_ENABLED` is on, capture the
  cockpit "Propose interview times" card + student booking panel and add them like the other steps. (Logged 2026-06-18.)
- TD-127: **New PISMP rows (Pendidikan Khas `…H`, Prasekolah `…H7P`, MBPK `50BK…`) carry cloned generic descriptions.**
  During the 2026-06-18 catalogue reconciliation, the B/D/L→H swap and the MBPK ingest created rows whose `description`
  was cloned from a Perdana sibling rather than written for the specific bidang. They're correct on code/name/
  requirements but the prose is generic. **To resolve:** write proper bidang-specific descriptions (the retired B/D/L
  rows' bespoke Braille/BIM/autism copy is in `Downloads/sk_sjkc_retire_backup_2026-06-18.json` and can seed them).
  Low priority — cosmetic, doesn't affect eligibility or selection. (Logged 2026-06-18.)
- TD-128: **MBPK eligibility gate under-captures non-physical special-needs.** MBPK courses are gated on the existing
  onboarding "Physical disability" checkbox (`req_disability`), but MBPK also covers learning / hearing / visual needs
  (the old B/D/L categories) which that single signal doesn't capture — a deliberate partial proxy chosen for
  simplicity (see decisions.md). **To resolve, if matching proves too narrow:** broaden the Special-Needs onboarding
  field into typed categories and gate MBPK on the union. (Logged 2026-06-18.)
- TD-129: **SJKT PISMP bidang carry an over-specified language requirement (BT in the C-group).** The official 2026 IPGM
  Perdana syarat lists C in **3** subjects (Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Inggeris, Sejarah), but several SJKT bidang
  requirements store a 4-subject C-group `[BM, BT, HISTORY, BI]` (Bahasa Tamil added). Harmless in practice — an SJKT
  applicant trivially has BT ≥ C — so it never changes an outcome, but it's a minor deviation from the PDF surfaced
  while investigating the picker. **To resolve:** drop BT from the C-group (or confirm it's intentional) at the next
  PISMP courses refresh, alongside TD-127. (Logged 2026-06-19.)
- TD-130: **Unsubscribe risk on transactional emails (definitive fix is Brevo-side).** Brevo auto-injects a
  `List-Unsubscribe` header on ALL mail it relays, including transactional — so Gmail shows an "Unsubscribe" button, and a
  mistaken click may add the contact to Brevo's suppression list and silently stop future service mail. We shipped a
  code-side shim on **interview** emails (our own harmless `mailto:help@` `List-Unsubscribe`, no one-click POST), but the
  **decision + application-completion reminder emails still carry Brevo's default unsubscribe**, and Brevo may still inject
  its own header alongside ours. **To resolve:** ask Brevo support to enable **List-Help instead of List-Unsubscribe on
  transactional** (account-wide, certain fix); then drop the mailto shim. Owner action (free-tier support latency unknown).
  Interim option: extend the same `mailto:` shim to the decision/reminder send paths. (Logged 2026-06-19.)
- TD-131 **✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-19):** built the verdict-completion SLA enforcement — `send_review_nudges` cron
  (dark behind `REVIEW_NUDGES_ENABLED`) nudges the assigned reviewer 2 days before + once overdue, escalates to all
  super-admins 4 days after the due date (`assigned_at + REVIEW_SLA_DAYS`), idempotent via stamps reset on
  (re)assignment, cancelled by a recorded `verdict_decided_at`; the verdict-due date is also surfaced in the reviewer
  interview reminder. Migration `0064` (migrate-first). The original debt:
- TD-131 (original): **No verdict-completion clock or overdue-verdict nudge for reviewers.** The reviewer-assigned email now shows a
  soft "Please review by {date}" (`REVIEW_SLA_DAYS`, default 7), but it is **display-only** — nothing tracks whether a
  reviewer actually records a verdict, and there is no reminder or escalation if they don't. (`decision_due_at` is the
  *student-facing* delayed-reveal timer, not a reviewer deadline.) The missing email in the reviewer lifecycle is the one
  that prevents a stuck case: *"you interviewed {ref} N days ago but haven't recorded a verdict."* **To resolve (own
  change):** add a verdict-due field/SLA, a detection job (interviewed/assigned + no verdict past the SLA), and an
  overdue-verdict nudge email; only then surface the due date in the **interview reminder** too (the deferred external-review
  point — a date with teeth, not a soft target that can already be in the past by interview time). (Logged 2026-06-19.)
- TD-132: **R1 sponsor-portal Tamil strings are first-drafts.** The new `sponsorPortal.nav` / `students` / `account`
  keys (+ `myStudents.none`) were added EN/MS/TA in lockstep, but the Tamil is a first-draft for owner refinement per
  `tamil-style-guide.md`. **To resolve (owner):** refine the Tamil copy on the three new sponsor-portal blocks.
  (Logged 2026-06-19, Sponsor redesign R1.) Related: **TD-101** (the Students "Support" button is a stub — funding not
  wired pending the owner's fund-UX sign-off).
  **Extended R7 (2026-06-20):** now covers the **whole redesign (R1–R7)** sponsor copy, not just R1. R7 also revealed
  that ~47 keys (`sponsorPortal.{impact,journey,activity,community,statement,students,account}.*`) were referenced by
  R1–R4 pages but **never authored in any language** — they were added EN/MS/TA in R7, so the **English is freshly
  authored (not just the Tamil)** and the **Tamil is a second-draft per the style guide**. A `sponsor-i18n.test.ts`
  guardrail now prevents missing keys recurring. **To resolve (owner):** a copy pass — **English AND Tamil** — over the
  full sponsor portal (My Giving / Students / Account / Trust / AutoSponsor) on the live site. (Mechanically the strings
  render correctly; this is a quality/voice pass.)
- TD-133: **R5 Trust & Transparency hub ships with honest PLACEHOLDERS — real content is owner-gated.** The hub's
  *Who we are* (legal entity), *Governance* (trustee board), *Sources & uses* (annual figures) and *Independent
  assurance* (auditor + FY report) render "to be published" / illustrative placeholders because the organisation is not
  yet formalised. The My Giving assurance strip likewise shows illustrative figures ("112 verified · RM 284,000 · FY2025
  · auditor to be appointed"), flagged illustrative. **To resolve (owner long-lead):** appoint the **independent
  auditor + trustee board**, define the attestation scope, and register the legal entity; then the real content drops in
  by editing the `trust_content` DB row — **no deploy** (language-neutral data in the DB, trilingual chrome in i18n). A
  per-student `enrolment_verified` flag (the "Enrolment independently verified" badge) likewise stays False until that
  institution-confirmation process exists. (Logged 2026-06-20, Sponsor redesign R5/R7.)
- TD-134: **[RESOLVED 2026-06-21]** Gap in the TD-115 slot model — the slot key `(doc_type, household_member)` could not
  represent multiple reviewer-requested docs of the same type, so each Action-Centre "Other" upload overwrote the previous
  one (live data loss — Theepicaa app 4: 5 requested, 1 stored) and a cross-person income request (father's IC on a
  mother-STR route) overwrote the route doc. **Resolved** by `feat/request-owned-doc-slots` (commit `d9278f3`, migration
  `scholarship/0067`): added `ApplicantDocument.request_code` so the slot key is `(doc_type, household_member,
  request_code)`; the STR force-tag is skipped for request-keyed uploads; `resolve_doc_items_for_upload` resolves by code;
  `MAX_OTHER_DOCS=10` cap. +6 tests. See `docs/decisions.md` + `docs/retrospective-2026-06-21-request-owned-doc-slots.md`.
  ⚠️ Migration `0067` clashes with the unmerged `feat/whatsapp-comms` branch — renumber the later merge to `0068`.

  webhook `POST /api/v1/scholarship/whatsapp/inbound/` (`WhatsAppInboundView`) flips `whatsapp_opt_in` on STOP/START,
  Twilio-signature authed (`whatsapp.verify_twilio_signature`), number→profile via sent `to_number`. +5 tests. **Remaining

  number" flow via the **Twilio Verify API** (WhatsApp or SMS channel) → mark verified. Now feasible (Twilio wired).

- TD-137: **[RESOLVED 2026-06-21]** The 24h slot min-lead was frontend-only and applied to reschedule too. **Resolved:**
  reschedule mode now uses `RESCHEDULE_MIN_LEAD_HOURS = 2h` (the picker offers nearer slots + jumps to the nearer earliest
  day); first-propose keeps 24h; backend already accepted any future slot. FE-only (`interviewSlots.ts` +

  **Built (roadmap S2):** `_send_wa_proposed` in `propose_slots` (opt-in gated, links to the application page), dual-path
  (free-text in sandbox / template in prod). **Remaining to go live:** owner sandbox-tests the wording, then submit the
  Meta template + set `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_PROPOSED_CONTENT_SID` (dark on a real sender until then). (Logged + built 2026-06-21.)
- TD-139 **✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-20):** dropped `results_slip` from `genuineness.supporting_doc._GENUINENESS_DOCS`
  (it was scored by the SIGNATURE scorer — its upload branch wins first — so the holistic membership was dead);
  the slip branch is independent and the holistic set is now just STR. Test updated. (Originally logged as TD-133 on
  `feature/doc-eval-harness`; **renumbered to TD-139 at the 2026-06-23 merge** because main's TD-133 = the R5 Trust hub.
  This entry's number had churned 120→124→127→130→132→133→139 across parallel main merges — the exact collision the
  doc-eval lessons flag; resolved outright so the number no longer matters for tracking.)
- TD-140: **Bursary agreement go-live is blocked on two Phase-0 gates (DARK until both clear).** The Conditional Bursary
  Award Agreement shipped 2026-06-26 behind `BURSARY_AGREEMENT_ENABLED` (default OFF). It is a real legal instrument and
  must **not** be exposed to live students until: (1) **a lawyer vets the template wording** in
  `apps/scholarship/bursary.py` (it currently carries a "DRAFT — pending legal review" banner, EN+BM; Tamil not yet
  drafted) and confirms typed e-signature sufficiency for this contract type (Malaysia ECA 2006 — a bursary is not an
  excluded instrument, but confirm); and (2) **the Foundation entity + signatory are finalised** (interim
  `FOUNDATION_SIGNATORY_NAME/_TITLE/_NRIC` = "Suresh"; old agreements stand as signed when the entity changes). **To
  resolve:** owner/legal action (not code) → then set `BURSARY_AGREEMENT_ENABLED=1`. (Logged 2026-06-26.)
- TD-141: **Bursary parent surety signs IN-SESSION only — no separate parent-phone signing link (Phase 2).** v1 has the
  student and parent/guarantor sign on the same device in one sitting (`guarantor_method='in_session'`); the model already
  carries `guarantor_method='link'` for the future path. **To resolve (Phase 2):** a tokenised public signing page
  (`secrets.token_urlsafe`, mirrors the referral-link pattern) sent to the parent's phone via WhatsApp/SMS, gated by a
  Twilio Verify OTP, with reminders + expiry — so a parent who isn't physically present can co-sign. (Logged 2026-06-26.)
- TD-142: **Bursary agreement states a payment schedule it cannot yet honour — disbursement + suspension are still mocked
  (Phase 3; folds into TD-075).** The signed agreement *names* the RM500 + 10×RM250 schedule and the Foundation's right to
  suspend/withhold, but no money moves and `agreement.status` gates nothing operationally (the `is_executed` /
  all-four-signed state is recorded but inert). **To resolve (Phase 3, with TD-075):** wire real disbursement +
  suspension/withholding to `agreement.status == executed` + academic-progress signals so the stated schedule becomes
  operative. Until then the contract is a binding *instrument* on a mocked-money flow. (Logged 2026-06-26.)
- TD-143: **A birth certificate cropped ABOVE its header scores `not_birth_certificate`, not `suspect`.** The BC
  signature anchors live in the header block (`Sijil Kelahiran` / `Pendaftaran Kelahiran dan Kematian` / `Kerajaan
  Malaysia`); a screenshot cropped to the lower half (particulars only, e.g. corpus a27) loses them and the text score
  falls below 0.35 → `not_birth_certificate` (a harder "wrong type" verdict than the soft `suspect` a genuine-but-cropped
  doc deserves). All 13 unseen held-out BCs pass — this is a narrow header-crop edge. **To resolve (owner's call):** leave
  as-is (acceptable — half a BC isn't clearly a BC), OR floor a header-cropped-but-BC-ish doc at `suspect` rather than
  `not_type`. (Logged 2026-06-27, Layer-1 doc-recognition go-live.)

### [TD-144] Bursary-agreement panel: derive ticks from the real agreement when the feature goes live
**Status:** RESOLVED in post-award signing S5 (2026-07-01, commit `5abae484`). `AdminApplicationDetailSerializer`
now surfaces the real loaded agreement as `bursary_agreement` (signature timestamps + status + PDF; null when
off / no agreement); the cockpit seeds `bursary` from the detail GET and bases all four ticks on it — the
`: true` optimistic default is gone, so an accepted-but-unsigned case shows "–", not a false ✓. Countersign/
witness buttons are disabled until an agreement exists. See `docs/retrospective-2026-07-01-post-award-signing.md`.
**Context:** The cockpit panel is now gated on `bursary_agreement_enabled` (2026-06-27), so it stays dark while OFF. But the Student/Guarantor ticks still default to ✓ (`bursary ? !!… : true`) on the assumption "signed-by-now once accepted", and the admin detail GET does not load the agreement.
**Fix when enabling:** include the `BursaryAgreement` (signed timestamps) in `AdminApplicationDetailSerializer`, initialise the panel's `bursary` state from it, and default all four ticks to **unsigned** (—) — so an accepted-but-not-yet-signed case isn't over-stated. Reuses the existing `BursaryAgreementSerializer`.

### [TD-145] Wrong-PUBLIC-university offer is not caught when the declared institution field is blank
**Status:** Open (deferred fast-follow from the offer-validity gate sprint, 2026-06-27).
**Context:** `_declared_pathway` reads the declared institution from `chosen_programme['institution']` (often blank) / `pre_u_institution`. For a degree applicant who picked a course via the eligibility tree, only `course_id` is stored — never resolved to an institution. So a student who declares **UMK** but uploads a genuine **UM** offer shows no institution clash (`offer_pathway_match` compares against an empty declared institution → 'unknown', not 'clash'). #31 is caught only because its offer is *also* a non-genuine pemakluman; a genuine wrong-public-uni offer would slip through. This is a SOFT confirm, NOT a hard gate (UPU routinely places a student at a different public uni, and our course tree can be wrong).
**Fix:** in `_declared_pathway`, when `chosen_programme['course_id']` is set, resolve `course_id → course_institutions → institutions.institution_name` and use it as the declared institution so `offer_pathway_match` can raise a real clash → `pathway_confirm`. Mind the KM/KMK/SMK/KTE convention — the place token already bridges abbreviation↔expansion, so canonicalise on the place name, not the prefix. (Logged 2026-06-27, offer-validity gate go-live.)

### [TD-146] Retire the legacy `sponsored` status once the award-accept flow is rewired
**Status:** RESOLVED in post-award lifecycle S3 (2026-06-28). `respond_to_award`/`fund_student` rewired
(`fund_student → awarded`, acceptance → `active` via cool-off or Foundation counter-sign); `sponsored`
removed from STATUS_CHOICES, all status sets, the onboarding/finalising gates, admin maps + i18n; 0 prod
rows to migrate. Migration `0075`. See `docs/retrospective-2026-06-28-post-award-s3-awarded-signing.md`.
**Context:** The post-award lifecycle replaces `sponsored` (award accepted, in-programme) with `active` (executed) → `maintenance` (funded). S2 added the new statuses but **kept `sponsored` valid** because `sponsorship.respond_to_award` still flips the app to `sponsored` on award acceptance, and the in-programme/pool/progress gates still accept it (`pool.FUNDED_STATES`/`IN_PROGRAMME_OR_BEYOND` include it). Prod has 0 `sponsored` rows.
**Fix (S3):** rewire `respond_to_award` to set `active` (then `maintenance` on first disbursement, S4); migrate any `sponsored` rows → `maintenance`; remove `sponsored` from STATUS_CHOICES + the `FUNDED_STATES`/`IN_PROGRAMME_OR_BEYOND`/DECIDED_STATUSES/QUERYING_LOCKED/_TERMINAL sets + the admin status maps + i18n. (Logged 2026-06-28, post-award S2.)

### [TD-147] Retire the recurring `ScholarshipCohort.name` migration drift for good
**Status:** RESOLVED 2026-06-28 (small-change lane, branch `chore/retire-cohort-name-drift`). Added the
standalone state-only migration `0079_alter_scholarshipcohort_name` (a help_text-only `AlterField` —
`sqlmigrate` confirms `-- (no-op)`, no DDL). `makemigrations scholarship --check` now reports "No
changes detected"; future sprints no longer have to hand-drop the stray op. Deployed state-only (the
`django_migrations` row recorded on prod via Supabase MCP; no schema change).
**Original (logged 2026-06-28, post-award S5). Low risk, recurring friction.**
**Context:** Every post-award sprint (S1–S5), `makemigrations scholarship` re-proposes an
`AlterField` on `scholarshipcohort.name` (a `help_text` drift between the model and migration
state that no sprint authored). Each sprint hand-writes its migration to omit the stray op — a
reliable but repeated chore (now a documented reflex). **Fix:** add ONE state-only migration that
records the `scholarshipcohort.name` `AlterField` (no DDL — `help_text` is not a column change), so
`makemigrations --check` is clean thereafter and future sprints stop having to drop the op. Do it as
a standalone small-change / in the next consolidation review, NOT folded into a feature sprint (keep
it isolated so it's obviously a no-op DDL). Verify with `makemigrations scholarship --check` returning
"No changes" afterwards.

### [TD-148] Officer view of a student's bank details (the payout surface)
**Status:** Open (logged 2026-06-29, post-award S7). **Context:** the bank-details capture (S7) stores the
student's confirmed `BankAccount` (bank/account-no/holder) but surfaces it on **no admin/officer view** —
the owner's explicit scope ("stored in the DB but not displayed anywhere"). To actually *pay* a student,
an officer will need to see (and likely re-verify) the account. **Fix:** an officer-only Bank-details panel
on the cockpit (read the `BankAccount` + the linked `source_doc` bank statement; show `holder_verdict`),
gated like the other reviewer surfaces. **Folds into real disbursement (TD-075)** — build it alongside the
payout rails, not before (there's nothing to do with the number until money can move). Anonymity note: this
is a back-office surface only; the account never crosses to a sponsor view.

### [TD-149] No path to change a bank account after it's confirmed
**Status:** Open (logged 2026-06-29, post-award S7). **Context:** once the student saves their `BankAccount`,
the `bank_details_missing` task resolves and leaves the Action Centre, so there is **no student-facing path
to correct/replace the account** (wrong account saved, account later closed). The backend confirm endpoint
already does `update_or_create` (a re-POST would update in place) — only the FE entry point is missing.
**Fix:** a small "Update my bank details" surface (e.g. re-open the task, or a thin panel on the
award/in-programme page) that re-uses `POST /scholarship/bank-account/` (same hard holder gate). Low risk;
do when the payout surface (TD-148) lands, since that's when a wrong account starts to matter.

### [TD-150] Course matcher assigns a wrong public `course_id` (poly-IT synthetic majors; private programmes)
**Status:** Open (logged 2026-06-29, bursary↔recommender alignment). **Context:** the catalogue course
matcher (apply-form pick / `offer_pathway.resolve_catalogue_course`) sometimes binds a student's
`chosen_programme.course_id` to the WRONG catalogue course, surfaced by the institution-alignment work
(institution derived from `course_id` conflicts with the institution on the actual offer):
- **Poly IT (#95 Gokulleshan):** the recommender models several **synthetic "majors"** for a single
  Politeknik IT diploma (e.g. Data Management, Software & App Dev) and each major row is attached to a
  *specific* campus, so a student's IT offer can match a major hosted at a *different* polytechnic
  (`POLY-DIP-077` → Politeknik Seberang Perai vs his actual Politeknik Ungku Omar). The split majors don't
  reflect the real single-course/campus reality. **Fix:** reconcile the poly-IT synthetic majors with the
  real catalogue (one course, campus from the offer), or make the matcher campus-aware.
  **#95 stop-gap (2026-06-29, owner's call):** his offer is a GENERIC "Diploma Teknologi Maklumat" at
  Politeknik Ungku Omar (no specialisation), and Ungku Omar's catalogue IT diplomas are only the three
  specialisations (Software/Networking/Security) — none generic. He was assigned a PLACEHOLDER
  (`POLY-DIP-072`, Software & App Development at Ungku Omar, `source='placeholder_pending_specialisation'`)
  so the campus is right; the specialisation is arbitrary and must be corrected once known.
- **Private programmes (#31 Dhurvaashrii):** a private offer (no public-catalogue equivalent) was force-
  matched to an unrelated public `course_id` (`UL0010002` → UMK). A private/IPTS programme should stay
  **label-only (no `course_id`)** rather than be bound to the nearest public course. (#31's spurious id was
  cleared by hand 2026-06-29; the matcher should not create them.) **Fix:** the matcher must return no id
  when confidence is low / the issuer is private, rather than forcing the nearest match.

The institution-alignment guard (`offer_pathway.catalogue_institution`) already *refuses to act* on these
conflicts (it never swaps one institution for a different one) and surfaces them instead — so live data is
safe; this TD is about stopping the wrong `course_id` being assigned at the source. Low urgency (display +
funding both key off `chosen_pathway`, not `course_id`, for these pre-U/poly rows).

### [TD-151] Document-extraction & income-computation robustness (a recurring class of fix)
**Status:** Open (logged 2026-06-29, promoted from the small-change consolidation review). **Context:** five
small-lane fixes in June clustered on one theme — our OCR/Gemini pipeline mis-reads a real-world document and
the income engine then mis-gates the applicant:
- SPM slip 2-column under-read → 6/10 subjects dropped, 3/4 mis-graded `ok` (#66; `academic_engine`).
- Handwritten salary-voucher `ringgit|sen` columns concatenated (RM326.00 → 32600 → false per-capita RM8150
  over the B40 line) (#66; `vision` prompt + `income_engine`).
- Salary-route earner shown Optional/undeclared when pre-ticked-but-not-toggled; `effective_working_members`
  fallback (#90; `income_engine`/`verdict_engine`).
- `document_unreadable_blockers` passed a list (not the app) → `working_members` always `[]` → unreadable
  salary-route doc skipped the submission gate (`services`).
- IC/parent_ic stuck unprocessed (silent upload-OCR failure) → false `ic_service_down` consent block;
  `reprocess_unread_ic` self-heal cron (`services`/mgmt command).

Each was fixed in isolation, but the **class keeps regenerating**: a document reads wrong, nothing catches it,
and a B40 decision turns on the bad read. **Fix (a focused hardening pass, not another point fix):**
(1) a standing **PII-scrubbed extraction-regression corpus** — every doc that ever caused a mis-read fix gets a
fixture + a test asserting the corrected parse (so a prompt/parser change can't silently re-break it; #66's
scrubbed slip fixture is the seed); (2) a **read-confidence/sanity gate** on the income inputs (e.g. per-capita
or total-vs-declared-subjects sanity bounds) that routes an implausible read to review instead of trusting it;
(3) generalise the silent-OCR-failure self-heal (#11) so *any* doc with `vision_run_at` NULL is swept, not just
IC. **Guardrail already landed this cycle:** `wat_lint` now flags a feature/migration that rode the small lane,
so the *next* extraction change that's really a sprint gets caught at the lane boundary. Size: a 1-sprint pass.

### [TD-152] Bursary agreement is a NAMED-PERSONAL-DONOR contract until the org is incorporated (ACCEPTED interim; novate to the Foundation on incorporation)
**Status:** ACCEPTED known issue / deferred (logged 2026-07-01, from the lawyer's contract v2 review). **This is an
owner decision, not a defect to "fix" now.** The lawyer's `2026 June - Donor Student Conditional Agreement v2` recasts
the deal as a **two-party contract between the individual donor (Suresh Thirugnanam, personally, with NRIC + home
address) and the Student** — NOT the anonymised-Foundation model the code was built around. **Owner rationale:** Suresh
is not merely the donor; he is the **co-founder of the organisation being set up**, and is signing **in his personal
capacity** until that entity is incorporated. The contract's **Successor Company** clause (novation, cl. "Transfer of
Rights and Obligations") is the mechanism: on incorporation the Donor novates all rights/obligations to the company, and
`"Donor"` is thereafter read as the Foundation. So the personal-donor framing is a **temporary, intentional state**.
**What this defers (all downstream of the same exception — treat as one item):**
- The code's model is **Foundation-as-counterparty + two-way donor anonymity** (allowlist serializers, anonymised pool,
  leak tests). The *signed contract* currently names an individual donor → the anonymity model and the agreement diverge
  **on purpose** for now. `FOUNDATION_SIGNATORY_*` interim = "Suresh" already reflects this.
- The `bursary.py` template names the **Foundation** as the counterparty; the lawyer's v2 names the **individual Donor**.
  Until the entity exists, the *legal* instrument (v2) and the *rendered* template disagree — the owner is running on the
  lawyer's v2 wording, not the code's template, for any real signing.
- Personal exposure (Suresh's NRIC + home address to students) + personal liability are accepted for the interim.
**To resolve (on incorporation — owner/legal, then a code pass):** execute the novation to the new entity; swap the
agreement counterparty from the individual to the Foundation; reconcile `bursary.py` template wording + the comprehension
quiz to the final (Foundation) party structure; restore/confirm the anonymity model against the signed instrument.
Relates to **TD-140** (Phase-0: finalise the Foundation entity + signatory) — that gate and this item close together.
**NOT covered here (separate open concerns from the same v2 review, still to discuss with the lawyer, NOT accepted):**
30-day clawback/repayment; "no other bursary/aid" exclusivity; publicity-by-default vs our opt-in consent; wet-witnessed-
signature blocks vs our digital SMS-PIN flow; CGPA 3.0 vs the engine's 2.0; unilateral obligation amendment; the
referenced "Donor's Personal Data Notice" (must exist); mentor obligations made enforceable before mentoring is built.

### [TD-153] Partner-role least-privilege tidy-ups (UI delete-button mismatch + API-readable oversight lists)
**Status:** Open (logged 2026-07-02, from a partner-role permission audit). Two low-risk mismatches; neither is a live
PII exposure beyond what the role already sees, but both should be tightened.
- **(a) UI/permission mismatch — partner Delete-student button.** The student-detail page
  (`halatuju-web/src/app/admin/students/[id]/page.tsx`) renders a **Delete** button for the partner role, but the backend
  restricts delete to super-admin (`PartnerStudentDetailView.delete` → `is_super_admin`, `apps/courses/views_admin.py`).
  A partner clicking it is refused at the API — a confusing dead button. **Fix:** hide/disable Delete unless super.
- **(b) Over-broad gate on read-only oversight LIST endpoints.** Several admin GET endpoints check only "is this *any*
  authenticated admin?" (`get_admin()`), not the role — so a `partner`/`reviewer` could read them via **direct API**
  though the admin nav hides the pages: sponsor list (`/admin/sponsors/`), sponsorships (`/admin/sponsorships/`),
  graduation-message queue (`/admin/graduation-messages/`), verdict metrics (`/admin/scholarship/verdict-metrics/`),
  course-data dashboard (`/admin/course-data/`). No writes, no per-student PII beyond aggregates. **Fix:** add an explicit
  role gate (super/admin) per endpoint. **Note:** part (b) touches auth → sprint-lane, not small-change.
**Risk if left:** Low. **Size:** small (a few UI conditionals + a handful of backend role checks + tests).
(Renumbered from a draft TD-152 that collided with the bursary-donor entry when two branches numbered in parallel —
see the lesson on checking `max(TD-NNN)` before numbering, mirroring the migration-number rule.)

### [TD-155] Partner Scholarship view (org-scoped bursary students for a HalaTuju partner)
**Status:** Open — roadmap/future (owner direction 2026-07-02, not yet built). **Context:** the single unified
`partner` role (HalaTuju org rep, e.g. CUMIG) today sees Dashboard · Students · Profile (the course-selector
side). The owner wants to add a **Scholarship** menu for a partner that shows **only the bursary applicants
referred by their own org** (linked via `referral`/source → the partner's `org`), and **hides the menu when
the partner has none**. **What it needs:** (1) an org-scoped scholarship-applications read endpoint (filter
`referred_by_org == admin.org`, mirroring `get_partner_students` but for `ScholarshipApplication`); (2) a
serializer that gives a partner only the non-sensitive view of *their* referred applicants (decide the field
allowlist — a partner is not a reviewer/sponsor, so no verdict/QC internals, and mind two-way anonymity);
(3) the partner nav gains a conditional `scholarship` item shown only when the count > 0; (4) the FE list
page filtered to the partner's org. **Note:** "BrightPath Partner" as a *separate* role was considered and
**dropped** — there is one unified `partner`. **Risk if left:** none (feature not promised to users yet).
**Size:** small-to-medium (one scoped endpoint + serializer + nav conditional + a list view + tests).

### [TD-151] Booked interviews kept "phantom holds" on the reviewer's calendar — RESOLVED 2026-07-03
**Status:** RESOLVED (logged + implemented 2026-07-03, `feat/interview-comms`). **Context:** when a student
booked one of the reviewer's 3 proposed times, the two unpicked sibling slots stayed `is_active=True` (they
are the student's re-pick menu) AND kept counting as reviewer-busy — so every completed booking blocked two
extra times on the reviewer's grid (seen live: Rohini's #80 siblings struck out Moven's #78 picker with only
3.5 bookable evening hours in a day). **Fix (owner-specified model):** a booked application HOLDS only its
booked slot; the unpicked siblings are RELEASED — re-offerable to other students, first to book wins, and a
released time re-offered elsewhere disappears from the original student's re-pick menu (server-guarded on a
stale page). Single source of truth `scheduling.held_starts()` used by the propose guard, the `reviewer_busy`
payload, the student slot list, and the `book_slot` race backstop (first booking blocks only on a confirmed
booking elsewhere; a re-pick blocks on anything held).

### [TD-152] Student had NO channel to the reviewer inside the 12h cutoff — RESOLVED 2026-07-03
**Status:** RESOLVED (logged + implemented 2026-07-03, `feat/interview-comms`). **Context:** once booked,
reschedule/cancel lock 12h before the interview and "Ask for other times" refuses when booked — so a student
falling sick one hour before the call had no way to tell anyone (email replies land in the shared interview@
mailbox, and reviewer contact details are deliberately never shared). **Fix:** "Message your interviewer" —
always-open (every state, NO cutoff), stored on `InterviewMessage` (migration `0089`, RLS) for the cockpit
thread + audit, emailed to the assigned reviewer best-effort, rate-limited 5/hour, 1000-char cap. Student
panel section + cockpit "Messages from the student" block; en/ms/ta (Tamil first-draft, refine queue).
### [TD-156] Interview Meet "waiting for host" — no host is ever present to admit joiners
**Status:** Open (logged 2026-07-01). **Context:** interview Meets are created on the Workspace organiser
`admin@halatuju.xyz` (via domain-wide delegation in `meeting.py`), but **no human is ever signed in as that
account** during interviews. Reviewers and students join with their **personal Gmail** accounts as invited
guests. Whenever Meet decides a joiner must be admitted — external guest, signed into a different account
than the invited one, or org host-management requiring admission — it shows *"you'll be admitted when the
host allows you"*, and because the host is never in the room the knock is **never answered** (stuck forever).
Reported by reviewer **Kaneswaran Sinakalai** (`kaneswaran@gmail.com`, admin #6) on his #51 interview (since
cancelled). Affects **reviewers AND students**, all interviews — not a per-user glitch. **Fix (owner-chosen,
2026-07-01): enable Quick Access** on `admin@halatuju.xyz` (Google Admin console → Apps → Google Meet → Meet
safety / host-management) so meetings run **without a host present** and guests join without knocking.
**Trade-off accepted by owner:** loses the waiting-room privacy gate on sensitive interviews with minors /
financial-hardship PII; mitigated by the **unique single-use Meet link per interview** (already the case) +
private distribution + a standing "never forward the link" rule. **Optional eng hardening:** set the Meet
space `accessType=OPEN` per-event via the **Google Meet REST API** at creation, so it never depends on the
org-wide default (the Calendar API's `conferenceData` can't set quick access). Also brief reviewers to join
signed into the **exact Gmail they were invited under** (a mismatched account forces a knock even with Quick
Access edge cases).

- TD-157 (low): **officer "converted from S$X @3.15" chip on a Singapore salary slip.** The B40 income now
  converts SGD → MYR (income_engine), so a Singapore payslip reads OVER the line while the doc still shows
  the S$ figure — the officer relies on the existing "Singaporean payslip" warning to connect the two. A
  dedicated chip/note showing the converted ringgit figure + the rate would make the higher income
  self-explanatory. (Cockpit live-review, 2026-07-05.)
- TD-158 (low): **birth-certificate genuineness chip cap.** The genuineness scorer already assesses BCs
  (results_doc signatures → suspect / not_birth_certificate) and the verdict caps on it, but the cockpit
  BC row (Child / Mother / Father) does NOT surface it — a suspect/wrong-type BC still shows green reads.
  The other genuineness-scored types (ic/parent_ic/offer/str/salary/epf/results) already cap; BC is the one
  remaining gap. Same 3-line documentFacts pattern; not re-banding (signal already exists). (Cockpit
  live-review, 2026-07-05.)
- TD-159 (low): **surface `consent_blockers` in the cockpit "Cannot accept yet" panel.** The admin API now
  returns `consent_blockers` (the exact submission gate) per application, but the cockpit's yellow
  "Cannot accept yet — the applicant still owes" panel is driven by `application_completeness` (the 7
  parts) and shows only e.g. "Consent" — not the *reason* consent is blocked (a doc mismatch,
  offer-not-official). So a doc-gated student reads as "just Consent". Wire the `consent_blockers`
  list into that panel so the owner sees WHY at a glance. (Stuck-students round, 2026-07-08.)

### [TD-160] Partner invite: a 200-with-unparseable-body leaves supabase_user_id null → Resend won't rotate (low)
`_create_supabase_user` returns `(None, False, None)` when Supabase replies 200/201 but the JSON body
can't be parsed (`ValueError`), so the `PartnerAdmin` row is created WITHOUT a `supabase_user_id`. A
later Resend then treats it as a pre-existing account (no UID → "sign in as usual" email) and never
rotates the password — leaving that (rare) partner unable to get a fresh temp password via the UI.
Recovery today: the owner can delete + re-invite, or the partner uses Google / forgot-password.
Fix when convenient: on a 200 with no readable id, GET the user back by email to capture the UID before
creating the row (or store a "provisioned, uid-pending" flag and backfill on first sign-in). Introduced
with the durable-invite flow (2026-07-12); surfaced in the ship-readiness review. Low: needs a Supabase
200-without-a-body, which has not been observed.

### [TD-161] `confirm_pathway` doesn't handle a pathway-TYPE change (STPM→PISMP) — #43 (low)
When the student confirms an offer whose pathway TYPE differs from what they declared,
`services.confirm_pathway` updates `chosen_programme` + (now) the pre-U fields, but does NOT change
`chosen_pathway` itself. #43 declared **STPM** (`chosen_pathway='stpm'`) yet confirmed a **PISMP
degree at an IPG** (Institut Pendidikan Guru) — a teacher-training place, not an STPM Form-6 school.
So it now carries `chosen_pathway='stpm'` with a PISMP institution/programme, which is internally
inconsistent (PISMP is a degree pathway, not a pre-U institution pathway). Left UNFIXED and flagged for
the owner (2026-07-16, cockpit income/household arc): auto-coercing a pathway *type* on confirm is a
bigger, riskier change than the school/stream sync, and #43 is the only observed case. Fix when it
recurs: detect `op.detect_pathway_type(offer)` ≠ `chosen_pathway` at confirm and either re-home the
application to the offer's real pathway type or raise a reviewer flag rather than silently coercing.
Low: 1 known app; the pre-U sync otherwise behaves; the officer sees the offer document.

### [TD-162] Applicant list `ready_for_assignment` is an N+1 (one open-tasks query per row) (low)
`AdminApplicationListSerializer.get_ready_for_assignment` calls
`services.is_ready_for_assignment(obj)` per row, and its `open_student_tasks(...).exists()` is one
query per application — ~25-50 extra queries per list page at current page sizes. Fine at today's
cohort (~140 apps, paginated); annotate/prefetch (an EXISTS subquery on the list queryset) if the
cohort or page size grows enough to notice. Introduced with the not-ready-first-assignment list
gate (assignment-surfaces round, 2026-07-16).

- TD-163: **Contract template Preview tab shows "Could not render the preview" + the "Open PDF" button misbehaves (draft `2026-v1`, brightpath).** Owner-observed 2026-07-19 on `/admin/contracts/<id>` Preview tab (EN). The inline preview iframe rendered the header/notice but surfaced a red "Could not render the preview." banner, and clicking **Open PDF** did not open cleanly. **PARKED as future work** at the owner's request. **Likely NOT the IBM Plex Serif change** — `render_agreement_html` + `generate_pdf` are covered by 72 passing contract tests, the `bursary_e2e` command generates a real PDF end-to-end, and the font change only altered the body `font-family` string (a CSS value can't break HTML/iframe rendering). More probable: the *draft* template is missing a piece the full render needs (e.g. no active/complete schedule row or a config field), so the preview/PDF render raises for this specific draft state, OR the FE preview fetch (`AdminContractPreviewView`) / the Open-PDF blob handler errors on a draft. **To investigate when picked up:** (a) reproduce by rendering the prod `brightpath/2026-v1` draft through `render_agreement_html` + `generate_pdf` with its actual data; (b) check `AdminContractPreviewView` + the FE `TemplatePreview` "Open PDF" handler for a draft-incomplete path; (c) make the preview degrade gracefully (render what exists, or show a clear "complete the schedule/config first" message) rather than a bare "Could not render". Low urgency — the contract module is behind the OFF flags; a real template is authored + vetted before go-live. (Logged 2026-07-19)
  **RESOLVED 2026-07-21.** Root cause was NOT rendering (verified: the exact prod `2026-v1` content renders to a valid PDF) and NOT a draft-incomplete state. It was a **query-param collision**: the Open-PDF URL used `?format=pdf`, and `format` is DRF's reserved content-negotiation override — `?format=pdf` raises `Http404` (no `pdf` renderer) in `perform_content_negotiation()`, *before* auth and before the view runs, so the PDF branch was dead code. Confirmed live: `?format=pdf`→404, `?format=json`→401, `?locale=en`→401 unauth. Fix: selector is now `?output=pdf` (view + FE); `openPdf` opens the tab synchronously (was popup-blocked post-`await`); `render_preview_html` now escapes + renders hierarchical numbering + bold; distinct `pdfFailed` message; regression tests assert `?output=pdf` streams a PDF and `?format=pdf` 404s. See lessons.md ("`?format=<x>` is RESERVED by DRF").

- TD-164: **The embargoed-decline status mask is hardcoded to `'interviewed'` — it should mask to `pre_decline_status`.** `ApplicationReadSerializer.get_status` hides an unrevealed rejection from the student by returning `'interviewed'` while `pending_rejection_category` is set. That was correct when the only embargoed decline came from a reviewed case, but `admin_reject('interview', …)` is permitted from `shortlisted` / `profile_complete` / `interviewing` too — so an embargoed decline of a **shortlisted** student would show them a stage they never reached, for the whole cool-off window, while every write path silently 403s them (uploads/edits gate on `POST_SHORTLIST_EDITABLE`, which a rejected app has left). The correct target already exists and is already populated: `pre_decline_status`, snapshotted by `_record_reject` precisely so `cancel_pending_decline` can restore it — the same fix the 2026-07-03 code-health round applied to the cancel path but not to the mask. **⚠️ CORRECTED 2026-07-22 — THIS IS LIVE, NOT INERT.** This entry originally said "currently inert in production (`DECLINE_COOLOFF_DAYS=0`)". **That was wrong.** `gcloud run services describe halatuju-api` shows **`DECLINE_COOLOFF_DAYS = 7`** — the 7-day embargo is ACTIVE and has been for some time. The original claim was read off the *code default* (`os.environ.get('DECLINE_COOLOFF_DAYS', '0')`) instead of the running service, the exact failure lessons.md already warns about twice. **Evidence at the time of correction:** two applications sat mid-embargo — **#137** (rejected 15/07 from `profile_complete`, email due 22/07) and **#13** (rejected 17/07 from `interviewing`, due 24/07); both were being shown `'interviewed'`.

**Actual current impact — real but bounded.** The mask's job is to hide the rejection, and it does that. The misreport only *matters* when `pre_decline_status` is far from `'interviewed'`: a decline from **`shortlisted`** would show the student an unearned jump to "Interviewed" for the full 7 days while every write path 403s them. Neither live case is `shortlisted`, so nobody is currently seeing an implausible stage — but `INTERVIEW_REJECT_FROM` permits `shortlisted`, so one reviewer decline from that stage produces it. **The org-admin reject (`org_admin_reject`) is NOT affected** — it never sets the pending markers, verified live on app #86 (email sent 29 ms after the click, `decline_due_at` null).

**To resolve:** return `obj.pre_decline_status or 'interviewed'` (keep the legacy fallback for rows predating the snapshot), and add a test that embargoes a decline from `shortlisted` and asserts the student still reads `shortlisted`. Two live rows carry a correct `pre_decline_status` already, so no backfill is needed. **Owner decision 2026-07-22: park as managed debt, do not hotfix.** (Found during the org-admin reject sprint 2026-07-21; the flag error found + corrected 2026-07-22 while answering an unrelated question about awards. See `docs/retrospective-2026-07-21-org-admin-reject.md`.)

- TD-165: **The org-admin reject card is component-untested (its pure gate is not).** The three-step card (button → mandatory reason → "Are you sure?") on `/admin/scholarship/[id]` is covered by `next build` typing + the backend `test_org_reject.py`; the step machine, the disabled-until-non-blank Reject button, and the error path that must PRESERVE the typed reason on a failed submit are not rendered in jest. The load-bearing *decision* logic IS unit-tested (`officerCockpit.canOrgReject` — 4 tests pinning super/org_admin × `shortlisted`), which is why this is low priority rather than a gap in the gate itself. A jsdom harness exists (see TD-065), so this is not infra-blocked. **To resolve:** a jsdom test driving idle → form → confirm, asserting Reject stays disabled on whitespace and that a rejected POST keeps the textarea contents. Note this action is irreversible, so the confirm step is the only safety net — it is worth covering. (Introduced 2026-07-21; same family as TD-065.) **Extended 2026-07-23:** the **reporting-date box** (above Recommendation) is likewise component-untested — its stage gate IS unit-tested (`officerCockpit.showsReportingDateBox`, 5 cases), so what is uncovered is the render/submit wiring and the error path. Same remediation, same jsdom harness.
