## 1. UI/UX Flow Rework (CRITICAL)

**Status:** Not started - User feedback indicates confusion

**Problem:**
- Users don't understand the app flow
- Unclear navigation between steps
- Users give up and leave before completing profile

**Current Flow Issues (to investigate):**
- [ ] Landing page unclear on what to do first
- [ ] Grade entry → Quiz → Results flow not guided
- [ ] No progress indicator showing where user is
- [ ] Sidebar vs main content confusion
- [ ] Mobile experience issues

**Potential Solutions:**
- Step-by-step wizard with clear progress
- Onboarding tour for first-time users
- Simplified landing with clear CTA
- Reduce cognitive load per screen

**Action:** Need user journey analysis and specific pain points before implementation.
